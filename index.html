        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello, I write fanfiction for fun. I also write original stuff. I have a tumblr, AO3, revospring, and twitter (X) account. So if you see me on any other platform with this username, then that probably isn't me. Or it's an inactive account I forgot about. I've been active since June 13, 2023 and I mostly use this website to store my stories.<br>I very often write about sensitive subjects such as abuse, and all the like. But sometimes I do write "fluff". My fanfiction will always include warnings about the contents of the story, no matter if it spoils it or not. I think it's important for my readers to know what they're getting into. If you have any questions, my tumblr ask box is always open. which you can find a link to in the "extras" page.<br>Sorry if this website isn't pretty to look at, I tried my best!
        </p>
