            <a href="/fanfictions.html">Back to content list</a>
            <p dir="ltr">When Heather McNamara heard a plate breaking accompanied by screams and curses, she knew that her parents were fighting again. She knows nothing of the issue that caused it, but that hardly matters. The house was such in a disordered state that she found it impossible to sleep. From the number of things crashing and breaking, it would seem that this fight would last for an hour or two. So, she decided, as usual, to sneak out and wait at the bus stop.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her parents never did ever notice when she left or reappeared, they don't bother to check her room. After all, what business do they have there? She likes the privacy, but the negligence caused her to make some poor choices in her life. Like, for example, getting herself involved with people like Heather Chandler and Heather Duke. McNamara, dressed in her night clothes, folded up her blanket and wore her indoor slippers.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She unlocks her window and lifts it open, feeling the cold breeze of the night. She stares at the horizon, the view of their neighborhood never did look beautiful, rather it looked gloomy. Every house seemed empty, but the lights that turn on and off every night reminds her that there's life inside. McNamara looks up to the sky. It should be around 8 PM, she estimated. She expects herself to be home in thirty minutes or so. She opens her window wider, getting one leg out. Accustomed to such nights, she easily climbed out and managed to carefully come down without breaking a bone.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She uses the blanket to cover herself and walks to the bus stop she always waits at. She uses the bench to lay on and pulls the blanket over her body. She didn&rsquo;t care how she would look to anyone passing by. McNamara lets out a heavy sigh, she felt nothing much. And nothing interesting ever did occupy her mind. She's at a loose end and she didn&rsquo;t own anything that would distract her during nights like these.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She began to think, maybe a nap would be good. Her eyelids felt heavy, and at this hour, she would be sleeping soundly in her bed. She meditated, and made her decision.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara closes her eyes, intending to nap for only a few minutes. Despite of how uncomfortable a metal bench must be, she easily drifted off to sleep. So absorbed in slumber, she doesn&rsquo;t notice that it started raining, she doesn&rsquo;t notice the sounds of a vehicle stopping in its tracks in front of the bus stop. She continued to sleep until she was violently woken up by someone grabbing her feet and pulling her off the bench. Her body struck the concrete sidewalk; it was so sudden that she laid there paralyzed for a moment before regaining her sense.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She first hears the sound of rain, then a wild laugh. As her vision cleared, she sees a pair of rain boots. Her eyes widened in alarm, thinking that it&rsquo;s an officer. She quickly stood on her feet, clutching her blanket close to her chest. Fear settles in her heart. But what she sees is not the face of an officer but a familiar one.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Merry Christmas.&rdquo; Heather Duke greeted, a grin on her face. She&rsquo;s wearing a coat three sizes too big on her. On one hand she held an umbrella and on the other a plastic bag. McNamara could faintly see her jeep parked in front of the bus stop.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara knits her eyebrows. She pushes her, but not hard enough to trip her. &ldquo;What the hell, Heather?! You scared me!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke&rsquo;s grin did not disappear. &ldquo;I knew you looked familiar. I almost didn&rsquo;t recognize you in that get-up.&rdquo; She wagged her head; her eyes scan her from head to foot. &ldquo;Did your parents kick you out or something?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she fixes her hair and took a deep breath. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re fighting, so I&rsquo;m waiting it out here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Waiting it out?&rdquo; Duke echoed with a chortle. &ldquo;I drove past you two hours ago and when I come back here, you&rsquo;re still on the bench sleeping.&rdquo; She holds up a plastic bag. &ldquo;I even bought food, I thought you were some homeless dude. But I guess not.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara rolled her eyes, crossing her arms. &ldquo;Okay, I might&rsquo;ve slept for longer than I thought. So what?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s raining, and I&rsquo;m too nice to leave you here all soaking and wet.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She raises an eyebrow. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not though, the bus stop has a roof.&rdquo; She points up.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">In response, Duke aims her open umbrella at her and spins it, causing the water droplets to drench her. McNamara uses her hands to cover herself. &ldquo;Heather, what the fuck is wrong with you?! Stop that!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well, now you are.&rdquo; Duke nods to her jeep. &ldquo;Come on, get in my jeep. The rain isn&rsquo;t going to stop any time soon.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;My parents are gonna notice us pulling up in the driveway, are you trying to get me in trouble?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke shook her head. &ldquo;Who said I&rsquo;m taking you to your place? We&rsquo;re going to my house.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara stared at her, wondering if she should accept the invitation. &ldquo;No, leave me alone. You&rsquo;ve already had your fun.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Duke shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;Whatever you say.&rdquo; She starts to walk away. McNamara saw the movement, reflected, and quickly withdrew her decision.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Wait &mdash; alright, fine I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; She groans as she joins Duke under her umbrella.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara walked along without seeing Duke, as she knew that she had a self-satisfied smile on her face.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke opens the front passenger seat door for her, to which McNamara made a small comment at: &ldquo;I could&rsquo;ve done that myself.&rdquo; Duke doesn&rsquo;t seem to care about what she said, wordlessly getting in the driver&rsquo;s seat. She tosses the umbrella in the backseat. She inserts a key into the ignition, starting up the vehicle.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara looks about, it&rsquo;s not always that she gets to see what&rsquo;s in Duke&rsquo;s jeep. She notices two bags of groceries in the backseat. It&rsquo;s not many items. &ldquo;So, how long were you out buying groceries again?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Two hours, I think.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;For these?&rdquo; She nods to the bags.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke doesn&rsquo;t reply and only hands her what seems like a grocery list. McNamara takes it from her and reads it. Each item that was listed had additional details, such as size, ml amount, preferred brands, price, and specific nutritional information.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; McNamara gives her back the list.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Sometimes I have to go to multiple stores to get what they want.&rdquo; Duke sighed and began to drive.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara yawns, reclining in her seat. &ldquo;Hurry up and drive faster,&rdquo; she jokingly complained, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting tired.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke rolls her eyes. &ldquo;Jump out if you&rsquo;re that upset.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She hums. &ldquo;No thanks.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara looks out at the changing view of the streets. No one was out, as expected when it comes to hours like these. She wondered if her parents had stopped fighting now, surely, they&rsquo;re asleep. She could just make Duke drive her back home. But having a sleep over at hers seems more exciting than going back. She tears her gaze away from the window and looks at the plastic bag Duke bought.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Can I eat this?&rdquo; She asks.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Help yourself.&rdquo; She replied, shrugging a shoulder.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; McNamara looks at the contents, it&rsquo;s a burger with a soda. She takes the burger and begins to eat it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What were your parents fighting about this time?&rdquo; Duke questions, her eyes briefly looking at her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;To hell if I know, once they start screaming, they bring up every damn argument they had in the last five years. They can&rsquo;t even keep up with each other, how can I?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rough,&rdquo; she chuckled. &ldquo;Do you usually do this when that happens?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara laughs. &ldquo;Oh, always.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Looks like I have to make sure I drive by the bus stop every night then.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'm sure you'll have a fun time trying to predict what time they fight; it&rsquo;s like living in a minefield with those people.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'd do it for a hobby.&rdquo; Duke jokes.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara finishes her burger, using the tissue in the plastic bag to clean her fingers. She notices the radio in the dashboard. She turns it on, nothing but static came on. The rain probably messed up the signal. &ldquo;Damn.&rdquo; She whispered under her breath. She turns it back off.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Your parents won&rsquo;t mind if I come over, right?&rdquo; She asks her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she shook her head. &ldquo;They kinda feel bad for you, you know.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara lets out a low whistle, giving her a teasing nudge. &ldquo;You tell me about them? That&rsquo;s cute. Did you tell them how much you wanna suck on my clit too?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Gross!&rdquo; Duke immediately exclaims. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get your hopes up, they saw your parents fighting at church. They just assumed that they fight in front of you too.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh, well, whatever. Just as long they won&rsquo;t tell me to get out of their house.&rdquo; McNamara shrugs her shoulders.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">They continue chatting about other matters. The drive there wasn&rsquo;t anything interesting, which should be expected. Eventually, Duke&rsquo;s house comes into their sight. She parks her jeep in the garage. McNamara put her blanket over her shoulders and helps Duke get the groceries inside.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke takes off her rainboots and stored away her umbrella before going inside through the garage door. They hear sounds of a TV show playing in the living room, purposefully left on to act as background sound. Her parents were in the middle of cleaning up the kitchen when they see them. They seemed surprised but smiled at McNamara. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your friend doing here, Heather?&rdquo; Duke&rsquo;s father asked.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke began to explain to them that something happened back at home. She doesn&rsquo;t give out many details, but her parents know that it involves her parents. They nod in understanding and ask if she had eaten yet, to which McNamara said yes to. They put the groceries on the kitchen table, leaving it for her dad to organize.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke leads her upstairs; her room located at the end of the hall. She opens it up and says to her: &ldquo;make yourself at home. I&rsquo;ll be back in 5 minutes.&rdquo; Before leaving to go get something.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara observes her bedroom. There's not many decorations to look or marvel at. It looks rather empty compared to the rest of the house. White walls, a standard brown closet, a bookshelf and a desk filled with paper, notes, and others of the like. She isn&rsquo;t an expert in interior design, but it could definitely use some work.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke comes back bringing a spare mattress for McNamara to use. She sets it down on the floor beside her bed. Instead of laying on the mattress though, she made herself comfortable in Duke&rsquo;s bed.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Thanks for letting me stay over.&rdquo; She grins to annoy her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke only rolls her eyes. She lets it pass, figuring that she had a hard enough time to deserve to sleep on a proper bed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara sits up as she watches Duke walk over to the coat hanger. &ldquo;Ever thought of putting up some posters? This place looks like a seclusion room.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Duke knits her eyebrows as she took off her coat, revealing an outfit that can already be considered as nightwear. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s that bad.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Woah, no wonder you wore a coat.&rdquo; McNamara playfully jeered, forgetting about Duke&rsquo;s horrible taste in decorations, that is, none.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Say another word and I&rsquo;ll throw you out the window,&rdquo; she teasingly threatened. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t in the mood to wear anything flashy to buy groceries. Rather not attract the creeps.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t attract anyone in any outfit.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke feigns irritation but a laugh slips out of her lips. &ldquo;Fuck you,&rdquo; she says as she put up her middle finger. She switches off the lights and yawns. She goes to her closet to take out a blanket before laying on the spare mattress.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Pass me a pillow, Heather.&rdquo; She held her arms out, ready to catch it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara grabs a pillow but doesn&rsquo;t give it to her. &ldquo;Say the magic word.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke groans. &ldquo;Pass me a pillow, please?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yep, here you go.&rdquo; McNamara tosses it over.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Both of them go silent. They could hear the rain pattering on the windows. Duke closes her eyes, ready to go to sleep before McNamara called for her attention.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Seriously though, thanks for letting me stay over. Maybe you&rsquo;re not really the bitch Ram says you are.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s whatever.&rdquo; She replied in a quiet voice.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What do you want in return?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Nothing, don&rsquo;t worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Despite her reply, McNamara went on. &ldquo;A new book? Maybe you should try taking a look at Leg Show or Swank &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke interrupts her. &ldquo;What! Can&rsquo;t hear you!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara laughs. &ldquo;Come on, what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She grouses, she couldn&rsquo;t think of anything but she&rsquo;s sure that McNamara wouldn&rsquo;t let her sleep until she answers her properly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, surprise me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Surprise you?&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Heather, I&rsquo;m seriously gonna go out and get you a pen that squirts ink in your face when you shake it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke finally ceases resistance. &ldquo;Fine, get me a bookend. I need a new one anyway.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Sure thing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Okay, now shut up.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara smiled but didn&rsquo;t say anything else. She rests her head on the pillow, beginning to feel tired again. She was glad that Duke found her on the bench. Even though she didn&rsquo;t really appreciate getting pulled off and getting drops of rainwater thrown at her. Her company was nice. Usually, she&rsquo;d be alone and musing about nothing. And there&rsquo;s a little part of her that hopes the next time she sneaks out during another fight, that Duke drives by the bus stop at the same time.</p>
