            <p dir="ltr">Heather McNamara enters the girl&rsquo;s bathroom, the palms of her hands are sweaty and her eyes alert. A while ago in the hallway, she caught sight of a silhouette that seemed to follow her. She wasn't sure of anything, but she hoped to have gotten the wrong idea.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara walks over to one of the stalls, and as she's opening the door, someone suddenly pushes her inside and locks the door behind them.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Fear strikes her until she finds herself standing face to face with Heather Duke. Her raised brows turned into a furrow, and her jaw clenched at the sight of her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What the fuck Heather?!&rdquo; She exclaimed.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke hushes her. &ldquo;I just want to talk.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You can do that without doing whatever the hell this is!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well I had to get creative since you keep walking away whenever I try to talk to you.&rdquo; She looked cautious, wary of people who might walk in and overhear their conversation.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Because I didn't want to talk, and I still don't.&rdquo; McNamara shoves her out of the way and leaves the stall, she starts to run towards the exit. But somehow, Duke beat her to it. She shuts it close and blocks it off with her figure.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Move out of the way.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Is a talk really that hard to ask for?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara crossed her arms and huffed. &ldquo;Fine, speak.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I want to be your friend again.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;And?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke raised a brow. &ldquo;Well, could we be friends again?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No. Now step aside, I don't have time for this.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara put a hand on Duke&rsquo;s shoulder, ready to push her away from the door. But in a quick moment, Duke shoves her against a wall, using the full weight of her body to keep McNamara in place. Duke tries to go in for a kiss, but she manages to keep her away.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; She yells, turning her head away from her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Why?!&rdquo; Duke exclaims in frustration. Realising she was likely drawing attention to the girl&rsquo;s bathroom, she quickly tries to compose herself, but the instability in her voice is clear.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Every stoner, crack whore, nerd, and geek in this school but not me?&rdquo; Duke&rsquo;s hand slowly comes up to cup McNamara's cheek, she's noticeably shaking, desperate. McNamara feels a sense of urgency in the air. &rdquo;Every stupid, sweaty jock in this school, but not me?&rdquo; Her breathing became erratic and her hand trembled. Duke tries to move her head so that she's facing her, but McNamara won't budge.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Every fucking nobody in this school but not me?!&rdquo; Duke finally manages to force her gaze forward by yanking her hair.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">There was a marked craze in her eyes, her surroundings seemed to darken the longer McNamara stared at her. She starts to worry about eventualities, but she can't do anything to prevent it, not in this position.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara could hear the frantic beating of her heart in her ears, but she dared to talk back. &ldquo;Because you're fucking insane! Let go of my hair, you psycho!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke gave a harsh tug to her hair in response, making McNamara grunt in pain. &ldquo;I get it, you're just trying to piss me off. You&rsquo;d really sink this low just to make me angry, huh?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'm not trying to piss you off Heather, I'm just hanging out with people who don't treat me like shit!&ldquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She bitterly smiles. &ldquo;God, it feels like I never knew you. &ldquo; Duke shook her head in disappointment before gently shaking McNamara's shoulders. &ldquo;Heather, you're losing yourself.&ldquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What&mdash; What the hell are you saying?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You're stepping way out of your lane, there's something wrong with you. &ldquo; Duke moves her head closer to McNamara's, a million voices urged her to push her off, but Duke pinned her down in a way that prevented her from moving. &ldquo;Use your brain Heather, come back and I'll fix you. &ldquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;N&mdash; no, I don't need that.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Liar.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke leans forward and forces a kiss to McNamara's lips. McNamara thrashes and writhes against her grip, but Duke remains unmoving. She was unable to move her head away as now Duke was using both of her hands to keep her in place. All she could do is purse her lips together and hope that she won't try to force them open.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara could feel that she doesn't want to stop anytime soon, so despite her unwillingness, she steadies herself and starts to return the kiss.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke&mdash; thinking that she's finally giving in&mdash; decides to untangle her fingers from her hair and move down the sides of her body. It gave McNamara some space to move her arms, although little. She places her hands on her shoulders, hoping to encourage her to put her guard down. Duke tries to go lower, but McNamara slaps her hand away, so she contented herself with wrapping her arms around her waist.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">They parted briefly for air, before McNamara took the opportunity to initiate the kiss herself, as she was still being firmly pinned to the wall. Duke started to lean back, and her hands went to be lightly placed on McNamara's hips. McNamara gently withdrew from the kiss and waited a second before slapping Duke across the face.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Fuck!&rdquo; She grunted in pain and looked shocked. Duke rubbed her palm against her cheek to soothe away the hurt as she stared up at McNamara with marked anger. McNamara wiped her lips with her sleeve and fixed her blazer, panting heavily. &ldquo;Go see a doctor, freak.&rdquo; She said before darting out of the bathroom.</p>
