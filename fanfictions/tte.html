            <h1>Through the Epidermis</h1>
            <a href="/fanfictions.html">Back to content list</a>
            <p dir="ltr">A familiar, irritating, pungent scent of smoke invades Heather McNamara's nose.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She turned her head to her left, she couldn&rsquo;t quite make out Heather Duke&rsquo;s figure due to an absence of light, but she knew she had taken out a cigarette and started smoking. She frowns, annoyed. She would have criticized her about it if she was bothered to do so. Instead, she decides to look at the environment surrounding them. She leans on the tree for support, soon falling into a deep state of thought as she observes the view. The scenery is less than impressive. A dull, old, run down farm, and just the sight of it will certainly deprive you of any joy. Not an ideal spot for a date, though calling it a date would be too generous. There&rsquo;s no romantic candlelight, or anything of that sort. Only silence with the person she&rsquo;s growing to detest, all while being swallowed by a fog of melancholy.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">They&rsquo;re only here because it&rsquo;s the only place they can smoke and drink without anyone telling them off. And even though this is where they frequently spend time together, the awful stench of cigarettes and cow manure eventually got tiring for McNamara. She tried complaining about it to Duke, but she didn&rsquo;t listen.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She&rsquo;s been thinking about it more than usual&mdash; how miserable she is with her. Heather Duke wasn&rsquo;t the type of person to take anything seriously, McNamara knew that. Yet it still shocked her when Duke gave her a rope when she opened up about her depression to her. She excused it as being a joke, but McNamara couldn&rsquo;t find the humor in it. She endured her facetious antics because of the thrill Duke gives her. She ignites a fire within her like no one else, and it keeps her hungry for more. But it could only go for so long until it reaches a certain point.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara contemplates breaking up with her here, of all places. She&rsquo;s been planning it for a while now, and it&rsquo;s half the reason why she even agreed to have a date at a farm in the first place. To get her in a decent mood before she breaks the news. It might be cruel of her to do it during a date, but if she puts it off for any longer she'll end up not doing it at all. Before she could ponder about it more, Duke suddenly pulls her in for a rough kiss, exhaling smoke into her mouth. McNamara immediately shoves her off, coughing. Duke laughs as she watches her do so. She furrowed her eyebrows at her, staring with anger.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She clears her throat before speaking. &ldquo;What the hell Heather?!&rdquo; She exclaimed, her voice rough. Duke puts on what looks like a grin.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think it was funny?&rdquo; She raised an eyebrow, putting a cigarette up to her mouth.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No! Are you fucking crazy?! You know I hate it when you do that!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke rolls her eyes at her, sighing. &ldquo;Lighten up a bit, would you? I&rsquo;m having a good time, you&rsquo;re ruining it.&rdquo; She says as she turns away from her. This is usually where their conversation would end, McNamara will silently sulk while Duke will be satisfied with herself for getting her to shut up. But McNamara wasn&rsquo;t going to tolerate it this time though.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;&ldquo;What the fuck is your problem? You can&rsquo;t just fucking do that!&rdquo; Her hands form into a fist.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke faces her, and she could vaguely see her knitted eyebrows. &ldquo;God, Heather! Calm down, it was just a joke!&rdquo; She says, exasperated.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well it wasn&rsquo;t funny.&rdquo; McNamara crossed her arms, giving her a severe look. Duke scoffed at her response.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Classic! Maybe you should go find some humour instead of cutting&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara snarled through her gritted teeth. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not even going to apologize?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Why would I even need to do that? It was a fucking joke, get over it!&rdquo; She retorted. McNamara let out a cry of frustration, running her hands through her hair.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;God, you&rsquo;re always like this! It&rsquo;s&mdash; pissing me off!&rdquo; She shrieks, her shrill voice hurting her throat.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re being irrational! What the fuck are you so mad for? You&rsquo;re screaming at me for no reason!&rdquo; Duke argued, her tone had a hint of bewilderment, like she's shocked that McNamara had the guts to say that to her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You know what? Fuck you Heather, I&rsquo;m done with you.&rdquo; She starts to walk away from her, her heart beating from the rush of adrenaline.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Excuse me?&rdquo; She stops in her tracks and looks off to her side.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Take me home.&rdquo; She sternly said, not wanting to entertain her for any longer.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No! What the hell do you mean?!&rdquo; McNamara hears her heavy footsteps, which causes her to turn around and face her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m breaking up with you, that&rsquo;s what I mean! Now take me back home!&rdquo; She clarified, making her decision clear. Duke falls silent. And it's just now that she realises how cold she feels, her sweat in the freezing air making her uncomfortable. The swaying of the trees, the faint sound of cars in the distance, and every breath she took suddenly felt loud.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be serious.&rdquo; She eventually says, she said it so flatly, yet ire bled through her words.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you have to say. I&rsquo;m done with you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What? All this over some dumb joke?&rdquo; She shouts in incredulity, astounded.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just that dumbass, it&rsquo;s all of these other things you&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh really? Name one thing I&rsquo;ve&mdash;&rdquo; McNamara interrupts her, making sure her voice overpowered hers to stop her from speaking. &ldquo;Heather, I can name more than one. You&rsquo;re not really helping yourself here!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Come on! Here, I&rsquo;m sorry. I&rsquo;ll make it up to you, okay? I&rsquo;ll do anything, just don&rsquo;t leave me!&rdquo; She begins to beg, melting into desperation.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Shut the fuck up, Heather. Just shut the fuck up! Look at us&mdash; our relationship! Just admit it already, we have a shitty relationship!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re saying!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lie to yourself, we&rsquo;ve never been happy, Heather. Never! Can't you see? It&rsquo;s the same thing over and over again! We fight, we fuck, and that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll change! Just tell me what I need to do! Please, Heather!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara looked at her with disappointment and shook her head. A sign that begging will be no use. &ldquo;Just&mdash; take me back home. I don't want this to drag on.&rdquo; She begins to walk towards the Jeep.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You dumb fucking bitch! You can&rsquo;t do this to me, you can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; She bellowed.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Kiss my ass! I&rsquo;m not changing my damn mind!&rdquo; McNamara shouted back, continuing to walk.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Who the fuck do you think you are? You&rsquo;re acting super fucked up right now! It should be me breaking up with you, not the other way around. You get so angry for no reason! I don&rsquo;t tell you this, but you scare me, everyday I feel like you&rsquo;re going to fucking kill me, but I stay because I love you! Why can&rsquo;t you put in the same effort as me?&rdquo; She could hear her yell.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Goddammit Heather!&rdquo; To her surprise, McNamara feels a harsh grip on her wrist. Out of instinct, she spun around and threw a punch at Heather Duke&rsquo;s face. It took her a while to register what she had done, it was an impulsive act. Duke howls in pain, holding her cheek that had just been in contact with her fist. Things never got as concerning as it did now, and even if Duke treated her as if she&rsquo;s some toy she can play around with, she still regretted what she did.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh my God&mdash; Heather, I&rsquo;m so sorry! I didn&rsquo;t mean it&mdash;&ldquo; Duke shoves her to the ground, smothering her in dirt. &ldquo;Fine! Let&rsquo;s break up if that&rsquo;s what you really want! Have fun walking back home, whore!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;...What&mdash;&rdquo; Her speech got cut off as Duke went back to her jeep. McNamara hurriedly got up and followed her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather, what the fuck are you doing?! You can&rsquo;t just leave me here!&rdquo; She reasoned, but she ignored her. She starts to fall behind as keeps tripping on the uneven terrain.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather?! Heather! Listen to me goddamit!&rdquo; Duke entered her jeep and started up the vehicle without letting McNamara in. Panicking, she tried one last attempt at convincing her to not leave her by standing in her path, but Duke paid no attention to her. Even as she almost hit her when she drove off.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara watches helplessly as her jeep disappears into the night fog. Wrath bubbled up inside of her, she wanted to pull out her hair, she wanted to bash her head against a tree, she wanted to curse Heather Duke for all that she's done.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Fuck you!&rdquo; Was all she could gather to say, tears started to well up in her eyes. Well, turns out it was a bad idea to break up with her in a desolate location! Things look bad, she's in the dark with nothing but the moon and stars to act as her light source, McNamara panicked as this dawned on her. She hastily tried to navigate through the dark, harsh, and muddy road, not caring if she had dirtied her shoes and feet. She&rsquo;s lucky enough that the rather rough path continued all the way to the exit of the farm.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her feet weighed heavily of mud as she walked to her house, a flash of light appeared in the sky, followed by an alarming sound of thunder. As if the cold air wasn't already troublesome, it's going to start raining soon. McNamara started to quicken her pace, not wanting to stay out in the rain for too long. At the very least, the rain would clean her feet of any dirt. She could feel a growing pain as she continued walking, slowing her down. At this point, it was already raining heavily, all that's left for her to believe that God had cursed her is if the lightning would strike her dead. She groans in annoyance, muttering swears under her breath. There is no time for rest, but McNamara longs for it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She finally reaches her house, staggering and dazed. She digs her hand through the potted plant that sat beside the front door, in search of a key. It took a moment for her to feel a metal-like object, she pulled it out with what remains of her energy. Her eyes felt watery, blurring her vision. She missed the keyhole a few times before finally unlocking it. She put her entire weight on the door as she opened it, almost falling on the floor when she entered.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The lights are off, it must be late.&rdquo; She thought, slowly closing that door behind her. Her mother should be asleep by now, so she proceeded to go up the stairs quietly, so as to not wake her up. She reaches the door to her room, carefully slipping through.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara switches the lights on, walking to her closet and picking out what clothes to change in. Even in moments of exhaustion she must clean herself, she can&rsquo;t stand dirtiness. She smelled horribly of unidentifiable stenches, like some disgusting concoction. She brings the clean clothes inside the bathroom, setting them aside. She undresses herself and throws her dirty clothes into the laundry basket. Before she enters the shower, she pauses to look at herself in the mirror. She's drenched in rain water, her hair is a mess, and her eyes hold an apparent weariness. But one detail that stood out the most were the marks on her body, some were self-inflicted while the rest were from Heather Duke.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke had never laid a violent hand on her, but now she&rsquo;s wishing that she did. She hated how she treated her better than any person in her life&mdash; well, that&rsquo;s not entirely true&mdash; but she had done some things that would put her above most people. McNamara found the thought of her being cruel almost desirable. If that were the case then maybe her mind wouldn&rsquo;t be so divided on her decisions. The things she had said earlier were words she yelled without any second thought, she&rsquo;s not so sure if she meant it. Duke only ever drove her insane, in a way that fueled both their deranged lust and her need for more.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The marks are a mix of old bruises, scars and bite marks from all the rough sex they had over the past few months. It was the closest thing to love they could have ever had. McNamara thought everything wrong with them would be fixed if she agreed every time she asked, sometimes she even initiated it herself whenever Duke was angry at her, thinking that it would elevate her mood in some way. Her mind was empty of any thought as her hand came up to touch the marks, she could remember how she got each one quite clearly. Every bruise she&rsquo;d receive from her made her feel better, not that it felt good, it just felt like something she deserves&mdash; punishment for all the sins she had committed.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Every moment flashes before her eyes, it makes her chest ache. The pain, the blood, the satisfaction&hellip; everything made it all too hard to forget about her. She couldn&rsquo;t lie to herself, Heather Duke had a certain charm to her that made her come back for more. She should hate her, she has too many reasons to. So she wonders why she feels this way. She's a terrible woman, yet she terribly needed her back.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She clenched her jaw and forced the thought into the deepest parts of her mind, but even then it still dwelled on her. She can't bear to entertain it any longer. She steps into the shower, turning on the hot water. The water takes her attention away from it all. She placed her focus on cleaning herself up, making sure she&rsquo;s completely free of any dirt or stains.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Once done, She gets dressed in her night clothes and laid down on her bed. She stares up at the ceiling, not having a reason to. Just a second ago she was tired, but now she can&rsquo;t seem to even shut her eyes. There&rsquo;s too much going on in her mind. She turns herself to lay sideways, and on her wall she sees a picture of her and Duke, framed. Her mood bitters at the sight, she sat up from her bed and grabbed it. She examined the picture, they were both smiling. She couldn&rsquo;t remember the state of their relationship at the time, but there&rsquo;s no point in doing that anyway. She decides that she might as well drain herself out by throwing away anything that reminded her of Duke.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara walked to her dresser and pulled out a roll of spare trash bags. She tears one off the roll and tossed the picture in. She then went to her desk and pulled out the flowers that were just sitting in a vase. The flowers were a gift from Heather Duke on their 1st anniversary, it was a combination of a bunch of flowers she doesn&rsquo;t recognize. She isn't the type to enjoy nature of any sort, though she still accepted the gift. It used to bring her some type of joy but now all she could feel when she looks at it is resentment.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She threw it in the trash bag. She then pulled open her drawer that was a part of her desk, inside was an innumerable amount of envelopes. Heather Duke would occasionally write to her, even if it was considered old-fashioned in their current time. She was good with her words, blessed with a silver tongue. But McNamara knew they held no meaning. She didn't bother to read them for the last time. She clutched several of them that could fit in her hand, and threw them in the bag until there was none left.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She sets the trash bag aside as she crouches down to see under her bed. She reaches for the scattered cigarette boxes Heather Duke would hide whenever she comes over. She had thought of throwing them out long before all this, but it was something that would&mdash; in the past&mdash; somehow make her think fondly of her. But such did not matter to her now.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her face contorts into disgust as she smells the cigarettes. She wastes no time putting it in the trash bag.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">That was all she had of her, not that she could remember anything else. She ties the bag into a secure knot and trudges down the stairs of her mansion, the carpet silencing her footsteps. She goes outside to her back yard, where the waste bin is. She opened it up and carelessly tossed it in. She thought about burning it, but her mother might tear her head off so she decided against it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She forces herself not to spare a glance and she ignores any reluctance that she started to feel. She quietly goes back to her room.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She collapsed face first in her bed, letting tears fall out of her eyes. The regret slowly seeped in, even when she knew what she did was for the better. She looked at her telephone, and then at her clock, in a time like this Duke would have called her up for a brief talk. She would have told her about what book she had just finished reading, or maybe the latest gossip, or&mdash; when she's in a decent mood&mdash; let McNamara ramble about what she had in mind.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She debates with herself on whether or not she should call her and apologize. Though she won't know what she would be apologizing for&mdash; apart from punching her&mdash; she knows that she wants to hear her voice again. She was aware that Duke would likely hang up the phone on her or tell her terrible things, but awareness didn&rsquo;t hinder the desire from growing. She clutches onto her pillow with a deathly grip, hoping that doing so would stop her hands from reaching for the telephone. The temptation only grew stronger as she looked at her clock and realized that Heather Duke is close to going to sleep.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">8:30. Only 30 minutes left. She watches time pass, every minute only adding to her uneasiness. 8:50. McNamara knows that she's almost done with her nightly routine, she should be in bed right now, McNamara thought. It's too late now, much too late. There's no point in calling her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She sits up and goes to dial her number. Her shaking hands held less hesitance and self-restraint with each movement. Halfway through punching in her number, she pulled the telephone out of its place and hurled it out her open window, not caring about where it had landed. She&rsquo;ll probably get a beating when her mom finds out, but on a more positive side, she won&rsquo;t be calling her up anytime soon. She looks outside her window, breathing heavily. She couldn't tell if it was broken or not, but what would it change in either case?</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She laid down on her bed once her breathing had slowed. She&rsquo;s too tired to feel horrible, her eyelids felt heavier than the weight on her heart. But before anything, she reaches for the drawer of her bedside table. She takes out a bottle of pills and swallows the little amount that was left. McNamara closes her eyes. The situation is comically grim when she thinks about it. All this trouble, just for some girl! Heather Duke would have been delighted to hear about this. This would only be a boost to her ego, but also a reason to keep her around&hellip; Heather McNamara desperately shook the thought off.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">No matter how much she didn't want to admit it to herself, she still loves her, or something similar to that. It&rsquo;s not right, but she can&rsquo;t help it. She could say that she&rsquo;s afraid of the change she&rsquo;ll have to get used to and that's why she&rsquo;s so hesitant in leaving her, but she&rsquo;s not too sure if she believes that&mdash; after all, she was the one who broke it off in the first place. Her mind was in a mess, too much in a tangle for her to make sense of it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Time eventually takes her where she wants to be. Her weary eyes blinked until she couldn't bring herself to open them up again, and the chatter in her head began to quiet down. She finally fell into a deep slumber, hoping that it would last for a lifetime.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Unfortunately for her, that won&rsquo;t be the case today. She woke up in a horrible mood, and decided that she can't go to school like this. She gets up from her bed to find her mother. It didn't take her long. As soon as she walked out of her room, she saw her cleaning the floor, it seemed as if she were cleaning wet footprints that stained their obnoxiously long carpet. The footprints were obviously from last night.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Why did you come home so late?&rdquo; Her mother interrogated upon seeing her figure. Her apathetic face turned into a fierce stare.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;And why didn&rsquo;t you think of cleaning? Christ, look at this mess!&rdquo; She gestures to the floor. McNamara winced, though she isn&rsquo;t all that concerned with the mess she made, she&rsquo;s more concerned that she won't allow her to stay at home if she asks.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;All you do is eat and sleep, is it really that hard to clean up?&rdquo; Her mom exasperated, gesticulating at her. &ldquo;When I was your age, my parents made me kneel down on a bed of thumbtacks whenever we made messes like this!&rdquo; McNamara only stares down at her feet without replying, there&rsquo;s no point in doing so anyway. She&rsquo;d rather not drag the argument for any longer.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Go get ready for school before I hit you.&rdquo; Her mom pinches the bridge of her nose, sighing in frustration. McNamara quickly does as she&rsquo;s told with no complaints, and she goes to shower. She doesn&rsquo;t stop to look at herself in the mirror this time.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She feels terrible, the pills left her in a sickly state rather than dead. As the water completely drenches her, her mind wanders off to what had transpired yesterday. She realises that she&rsquo;ll have to talk to Heather about it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;But maybe I don&rsquo;t need to&hellip;&rdquo; She thinks to herself. Maybe she could just avoid her and pretend nothing happened. That always seemed to work whenever they fought. Though, even with that in mind, she still felt anxious about going to school. McNamara shakes the thought off and finishes up with showering. She goes to change into her usual clothing and makes her way downstairs. She doesn&rsquo;t spare her mother a goodbye. Even if she did, her mother won&rsquo;t say it back anyway.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She walks to the bus stop and waits. It's cold today, she thought to herself. Her surroundings are quite foggy. Before her mind is able to drift about, the bus arrives. She finds herself a seat and busies herself with looking out the window, nothing in particular caught her eye. That is until the bus makes a stop, in the middle of the road, she saw a dog with its legs covered in wounds. Her face turns disgusted at the view. She could see bits of its bone peeking out, and she's sure that she sees maggots on some of its wounds. She watches as the dog struggles to walk with the little energy that it has left, and when it finally succumbs to its injuries, she looks away from the window until the bus starts moving again.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Blood suddenly splattered onto the front window, the bus must have run over the dog, she assumed. The driver didn't seem to react and only pressed a button to turn the windshield wipers on. She turned her head to look at the other passengers, they were all occupied with their own businesses, and the people who did see the blood did not make any indication of surprise or concern. The image burned into her mind, she felt itchy throughout her body. What a sight to see in the morning! It'll be a while until she&rsquo;ll be able to forget that.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She finally gets to school. Her heart starts to beat. McNamara enters Westerberg with her head down. She blocked out her surroundings, hoping to look disinterested enough that people wouldn't bother her. She stops by her locker and takes out the things she needed, she wastes no time getting to her first class &mdash; something she doesn't do often &mdash;&nbsp; she earns a number of strange looks on her way there, but they continue unconcerned. She&rsquo;s the first one to enter, she immediately sits on a chair close to the exit of the classroom at the back. Her wary eyes darted to every part of the room, her body turning uncomfortably cold. She shares an English class with Heather Duke.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">A small flood of students enter the classroom, making their way to sit down on their chairs. The crowd contained Heather Duke herself. McNamara watches her as she sits on the other side of the room, at the front where it&rsquo;d be hard to reach her. Duke doesn't make any move to look at her, McNamara's almost sure that she's pretending to not notice that she's there.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Today is a discussion of last week's topic, the teacher had informed the class. The class was divided into pairs, and McNamara got assigned to Duke, as usual. Any other day it would be, but considering what had happened yesterday, doing the activity will be a little bit awkward for them. Everyone stands up to go to their partners. Duke walks towards her with a notebook and pen in hand, McNamara averted her gaze to the wall next to her. It was when she felt like Duke sat next to her that she finally looked at her. They stared at each other for a while, an uncomfortable atmosphere engulfing the two.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;So&hellip;&ldquo; Duke started, removing the cap of her pen. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your interpretation of the text?&rdquo; She asks, reading off of her notebook. Their conversation would continue with neither of them bringing up their conflict, acting like it never happened. Much to McNamara's relief, she isn't ready to address it just yet, and she's sure that Duke feels the same way.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">After this interaction, they did not speak to one another, or even stand in the same place. Once they catch sight of the others figure, they&rsquo;d instantly leave unless it's necessary that they don't. No one seemed to notice this strange behaviour&mdash; and if otherwise&mdash; no one was interested enough to ask. McNamara went with her day as she always does, occasionally thinking of speaking to Duke but in the end, restrained herself every time.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">School hours end and McNamara takes her usual ride home, the bus. She expected a booming voice as soon as she walked in, but her mother&mdash; who was sleeping on the couch&mdash; did not make any mention of the telephone she threw out last night. Perhaps she hadn't noticed, that or she was too busy getting wasted on alcohol&mdash; which, by the way, several bottles of it were scattered throughout the floor&mdash; in an amount that would make her liver fail. Despite the irritable mess, she didn't bother to clean it. She walked up to her room and did whatever you might expect her to do: doing homework, studying, the typical routine of a high school student.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Soon enough, she can be found laying on her bed. Not a thought came up as she stared up at the ceiling&mdash; not even something about Heather Duke, which already is a surprise, knowing her&mdash; her eyes fixated on the closed lightbulb. She doesn't even feel the bed she's laying on, like she's floating, in the air, wandering about. She felt nothing. As if she didn't exist at all. The peculiar silence in her mind didn't break, and it continued not to until she felt her eyes slowly shut.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The night passes and the sun&rsquo;s daylight shines through her window and onto her face. She wakes up and goes to shower&mdash; during which she tries her hardest to avoid looking in the mirror. She went downstairs without saying a thing to any of the maids&mdash; who had been hired to clean up the bottles of alcohol &mdash; present in the mansion. Nothing worthy of note happened as she went to school and attended her classes. She didn't talk to Heather Duke at all, not about anything interesting at least. Every conversation they had was purely to get information about unimportant matters, something that disappointed McNamara. She had expected Heather Duke to bring it up. And if she was going to be honest, Duke is much more at fault than she is.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She wonders how she sleeps at night knowing that she abandoned her in the dead of night. Anything could have happened to her. Yet she sees her going on about her day seemingly without a hint of guilt&mdash; or even bitterness&mdash; in her eyes. McNamara questions herself if she meant anything to her at all. Like she was just a guy she had hooked up with and left the next day. Though it bothered her, she made no move to confront her. She instead decided that it's either that this issue remains unresolved or Duke does something about it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Hours pass by and school eventually comes to a close. Everything remains typical, nothing of significance. Her mother did complain about kids messing with their property though, something that didn't really pique McNamara&rsquo;s curiosity. As long as it doesn't affect her, it won't be something she'll need to worry about. The teachers didn't assign any homework earlier&mdash; since the end of the school year was gradually getting near&mdash; so she ended up spending her free time listening to the radio until the sun set.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Settling down on her bed she realizes that this time&mdash; for the first time in years&mdash; she finally felt relaxed, so she closes her eyes and savors the feeling gratefully.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Which was a good decision on her end. She wakes up feeling inordinately cold, so much so that it was a cause of concern. She looks around her and immediately spots shards of glass on her floor, as well as a rock. It didn't take her long to figure out that her window had been broken using the rock. She scratched the back of her head and stared at the rock in scepticism. If she had left her window open, it could have hit her! Before she showers, she goes downstairs and finds her mom, who was just a few steps away from walking out the door.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Mom? My window is broken.&rdquo; She says, a worried expression on her countenance. Her moms&rsquo; remained stoic.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Probably just the kids from yesterday. I'll get it cleaned up later.&rdquo; Was all she said before walking out and closing the door. She wonders what kind of situation her mom got into for there to be a bunch of kids harassing her. But then again, her mom is known for her displeasing personality, so something like this was bound to happen someday.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara proceeds to go shower and get herself ready for school, continuing her routine. That cold feeling never left her though, not even hours later when she had completely set aside what she discovered this morning. But she didn't let it ruin her day, she began talking to people again, engaging in conversations. She caught up with the latest gossip, like she had always done. Heather Duke still doesn't talk to her regarding their situation, which she&rsquo;s still bitter about, but she doesn't want to be the one to bring it up. And so the day went without any turbulence.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The bell rings, signalling that it's time to go home. McNamara does so, wanting to rest after such a long day. Her mom complains about the kids again, and she could tell that it&rsquo;s going to be a frequent topic from now on. She also mentions that she had gotten her window fixed, which she was glad to hear. She can't stand any more of the cold. She makes her way to her room and&mdash; to her annoyance&mdash; has to study for the practice quizzes tomorrow. But she decides to just listen to the radio halfway through her study time. Who was she to care about her grades?&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Time passes and she has to go to sleep. As she turned off her light, that strange feeling started to rise up again. She furrowed her eyebrows, confused. Her window is already fixed and shut. Maybe it's the weather? She questions herself. She tries to sleep it off, but no matter how hard she tries, her surroundings seem to feel more icy.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She didn't get much rest that night, she kept having to wake up to take another blanket from her closet to fight off the freezing temperature&mdash; which dropped down even more each time she woke up&mdash; she never succeeded. It started to irritate her at some point. She looked to her window, it wasn't broken, nor was it left open. &ldquo;It really must be the weather then&hellip;&rdquo; She groggily sighed and stood up from her bed to go shower. But before she could, her mother suddenly entered her room.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Have you seen the key to the house?&rdquo; Her mom looks stressed, and a little bit angry.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No.&rdquo; McNamara replied, dazed. Her mother slammed her door shut which made her jump a little. She could hear curses and swears from the other side of the door, shouting about the aforementioned kids, as if it's their fault that they had a habit of leaving their key in a potted plant. McNamara scratched the back of her head and carried on with going to shower. The water&mdash;&nbsp; despite having turned the red dial&mdash; was dangerously cold to the touch, but she persisted anyway.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her way to school wasn't any better, her heart was beating at a rather rapid pace. The same feeling she'd get whenever it's the day of one of her cheer performances. She really couldn't understand why this was happening to her, other than the upcoming practice quizzes, she had nothing to worry about. At school, she notices herself being more cautious of her surroundings. Constantly rushing to where she needed to go, her eyes darting to every corner of the room, and her sudden fear of being alone. &ldquo;What's going on with me?&rdquo; She'd frequently ask herself. She was too distracted with her thoughts that her teachers would scold her, interpreting her worry as misbehaviour.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her unease would continue until school ended, even when she did everything in her power to forget about it. At the school&rsquo;s exit, she tries to control her breathing, trying to desperately shake the feeling off. It worked a bit, her heart didn't pace like it's going to explode at any given moment. &ldquo;I just need to sleep this off.&rdquo; She concluded, and so she walked to the bus stop.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She enters her mansion to her mom yelling on the phone. She couldn't get any clues to what she was so angry about, but she didn't care enough to do so. All she could focus on is getting rid of the tense feeling that had been bothering her all day. She goes up to her room and immediately turns on the radio, the voices of the show hosts always did a good job at taking her mind off things.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She collapsed on her bed, covered in perspiration. She slaps her cheeks with the palm of her hands a few times, an attempt to gather herself. The reason for her anxiety remains unclear&mdash; and though she still wants to find out what exactly is causing it&mdash; she decides to put her mind elsewhere, maybe she had been thinking too much that it stressed her out. She places her attention on the incoherent sounds coming from the radio, she turns up the volume and buries her face in her pillow.&nbsp; Rest, that's all she needs for now.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara woke up the next day to the sounds of heavy rain. Which only amplified the coldness&mdash; that had gotten worse as hours went by&mdash; she had been feeling lately. She was at a loss of words of how to describe it, her nervousness had never gotten as worse as it did now. She brought her hand up to her face and pinched her glabella, letting out a sound of exhaustion. She could stay at home and risk missing some school work&mdash; something that&rsquo;s starting to look tempting to her&mdash; but she has cheer practice today, so that choice is off the table.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She stood up from where she had been laying down. And with heavy feet, she dragged herself to the bathroom. She takes off her clothes and turns on the hot dial. Her entire body went numb as the water drenched her, emptying her mind. She relishes in the short experience away from reality and finishes up with cleaning herself.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She goes downstairs and grabs an umbrella, soon murmuring curses under her breath as it suddenly opens despite McNamara having touched no buttons. She realizes that her mother had left her with the flimsy umbrella that was at least a few years old, she questions why they haven't thrown it out yet and bought a new one. But she decides that it will have to do, it&rsquo;s in good enough condition that it should still be able to cover her from the rain.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">As she walked to her destination, the rain began to pour harder, a fog starting to form. It blinds a small part of her line of view that McNamara only then noticed that she had stepped on some kind of bug when she arrived at the bus stop. She felt a little bit sorry for the insect but it couldn't be helped. She grinds her heel against the concrete ground, trying to scrape it off. The bus arrives a little later than usual, probably because of the rain, but it shouldn't be much of a problem.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The bus moves, and she feels something unusual. There was no crowd in the bus &mdash; actually, there&rsquo;s no one at all&mdash; but the air surrounding her seemed to feel more suffocating. She assumes that it's the horrible weather making her feel more depressed than normal, so she doesn't think much of it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She arrives at school and with only a few steps in, she could quickly tell that it's going to be another bad day. The hall was crowded and bustling, people were tripping and pushing each other, the floor was littered with mud and wet shoe prints, and pieces of plastic were scattered about. She tries her best avoiding the puddles that were gradually getting bigger the more students came in. As she went to her classroom everyone seemed to be more ungallant than usual, she couldn't count the times she got elbowed as she walked.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Class starts with a sense of unexplainable apprehension plaguing McNamara. You may get it by now, nothing important came up. The only thing setting this day aside from all the other days is the weather. Her less than merry start made her indifferent to the activities around her. She focused on that frigid feeling that never seemed to get any better. It was at its height during lunch time, the crowd overwhelmed her, and she had to go to the restroom to gather herself up.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara looks at her reflection in the mirror, she looks concerningly pale, her hair is a mess and her eyes are sunken. She looks like she just got back from the mines. With shaking hands, she splashes water onto her face to freshen up. &ldquo;Get yourself together.&rdquo; She says as she does breathing exercises to compose herself. &ldquo;What's going on with you?&rdquo; She muttered as if her reflection had a mind of its own. The bell rings, signaling that it's time to go back to class.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She tried to pay attention to what the teacher was saying, but it was no use as she ended up writing incoherent sentences and drawing inharmonious shapes in her notebook. As she started to draw another line, the voice of her cheer coach snapped her out of her mindless scribbling. He told her to quickly proceed to the school&rsquo;s field.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The rain had already stopped by the time she got ready and went outside. The coach made them do warm-ups before making them practice. She was underperforming a bit, but did well enough that it still made sense for to continue being the head cheerleader. The other girls snickered at her every time the coach told her off, and they began making snide remarks.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;She's clearly on drugs right now, look at her eyes!&rdquo; One says.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh, for sure. Who knew she got something else fucked up other than her snatch?&rdquo; The other replies and they all share a laugh.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Did you hear about her boyfriend? Maybe that's why!&rdquo; Their voices were obnoxiously loud, so loud that a person who's on the other side of the field could vaguely make out their conversation.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Their comments sour her mood, but she tries to look unbothered. After a few more minutes of practicing, their coach finally dismissed them, though he pulled McNamara off to the side to lecture her about her performance, to which she forced a smile and bitterly nodded in response.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">After packing up her things and leaving the institution, we see her walking through the parking lot, heading to the bus stop. She thinks back to the conversation she had overheard, and internally curses out the girls.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;They don't know anything at all&hellip;&rdquo; She mutters under her breath. She continues to sulk until she hears a voice that makes her stop in her tracks.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She turns to the source of the call, Heather Duke. She was near her Jeep, probably about to go home. And seeing her just now had made her realise that she hasn&rsquo;t seen her in a while. She seems to be calling her over, McNamara wondered what she would be talking to her for after such a long time without saying a word to each other. She walks towards her, curious.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">As she went closer, she could see her breathe a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Heather! I thought you&rsquo;d ignore me!&rdquo; She exclaimed, an unnatural smile on her lips.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara doesn&rsquo;t say anything in response, to which Duke takes it as a sign to continue. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make this quick. Look&mdash; I&rsquo;m sorry, like genuinely.&rdquo; She averted her gaze to elsewhere, seemingly too ashamed to face her. &ldquo;I thought about what I did, and the things I said to you&hellip; and I regret it&mdash; I&rsquo;m not looking for forgiveness! I just wanted to let you know that I want to change for the better, because I know a simple apology can't fix the damage I've done, and I'd have to show my regret through my actions. I know it sounds weird coming from me, but please just take my word on this. I&rsquo;m really sorry Heather.&rdquo; She ended with a sigh, McNamara couldn&rsquo;t help but feel astounded.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She had been waiting all week for her to say that, but something about it felt off to her. Duke had never shown to be an honest person, and her words didn&rsquo;t sound like hers at all!</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; She started, not sure what to follow it up with. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s&hellip; good? Goodluck with that, I guess.&rdquo; She looked at her with doubt, even when she showed some signs of genuinity. She knew that Duke was a good liar, it's how she managed to stay in favor with the students despite constantly mistreating them.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yeah, I'll get going now.&rdquo; Duke awkwardly said, opening the door of her Jeep. &ldquo;Oh, before I forget&hellip;&rdquo; Duke suddenly began, piquing McNamara&rsquo;s interest. &ldquo;Don't you feel something's wrong these days?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara stares at her with slightly widened eyes, almost scared to ask. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; She says, taking a step back.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Like&mdash; it's pretty cold, weird since it's almost time for summer, right?&rdquo; She smiles, her eyes relaxing. McNamara squinted and furrowed her eyebrows, perplexed. She had expected something more important than that.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I guess?&rdquo; She replied eventually.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;So why would you come here all alone then? Do you not trust your own gut?&rdquo; McNamara could immediately sense the maliciousness in her tone and quickly spun around to run away. But Duke caught her before she could even get a step in, McNamara screams for help, thrashing and kicking around to break out of her grasp.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Keep screaming, nobody's going to hear you!&rdquo; She could hear her laugh.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She feels some type of cloth bag being put over her head, obscuring her vision, and the next thing she knows is that she is being pinned down as Duke smashed what felt like a heavy object on her head. With each hit growing more and more aggressive, she tried fighting back, but the shock from it all prevented her from thinking clearly.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Heather Duke only loosened her grip on Heather McNamara&rsquo;s neck when she felt her go limp. She looks around her surroundings to see if anyone had been watching them, the possibility is unlikely. She had made sure that everything would go accordingly beforehand, but a little bit of caution is necessary. She can't be too confident, or else she'll get reckless.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke picks her body up with slight trouble, she isn't strong by any means. She roughly throws her body in the back of her jeep, climbing in her vehicle to position her in a way that it would look like she's just sleeping. She breathes a sigh of relief, it was easier than she had expected.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She drives to her house with no outside intervention. She made sure not to rush so as to not seem suspicious. She parks her jeep inside her garage, a place she usually keeps storage of rarely used items. But just a few days ago she emptied it out to make space for her plans. She gets out of her Jeep, and quickly climbs into the back of her vehicle. She can't waste any of her time, it's far too risky, the girl could wake up any time soon. She hastily takes hold of her body and drags her out. Grunting, she takes her to her basement, regretting that she hadn&rsquo;t used something to carry her, it would've made things much more easier. But this is her first time, so naturally, there is room for improvement.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She successfully settles her down in a chair. The basement is quite empty, save for a few couple of boxes, she only goes down here to control the power in her house. Next to the chair is a table, and on the table sits a thick rope. She grabs it and uses it to tightly restrain McNamara to the arm rests and legs of the chair. Not caring if it was too tight to be uncomfortable or stop blood flow, all she cares about is how impossible it would be for her to slip out of the rope. She grabs the tape, cutting off a small length of it and putting it over her mouth. Only then she allows herself to calm down, she almost wishes that she could do this all over again. She admires her work, seeing what a terrific job she's done. Her eyes move to observe McNamara's face.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Even with messy hair and a bloody forehead, she was still able to mesmerise Duke with her looks. In her eyes, she was beautiful, so much that it disgusts her. She cupped her cheek, feeling the sudden need to slap her. But she holds back, telling herself that she should wait until she wakes up. She gently moved away some hair strands that fell in front of her face to examine the wound. &ldquo;It isn't that big, it should be healed in a few days with proper care.&rdquo;&nbsp; She thinks to herself.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Looking at her, she retraces the steps she took to get to this point. Heather Duke&mdash; on the night after she left Heather McNamara in the farm&mdash; was sitting on a chair in the dining room, her head nearly dropping on the table after she scornfully drank half a bottle of alcohol. Her teeth clenched as she thought back to what had happened. The side of her face still swollen from that punch, she felt humiliated that she let it happen and was almost compelled to run McNamara over with her Jeep.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Heather McNamara. Just the thought of her sours her mood, her hand grips the bottle. &ldquo;Fucking bitch! Who does she think she is?!&rdquo; She disdainfully thought. In a burst of rage, she threw the bottle across the room, producing a loud shatter. She stares at the scattered shards of glass, soon calming down. She clicks her tongue as she stands up to grab her broom and dust pan, regretting that she had done it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">As she picks up the bigger shards of glass, she cuts her finger. She flinches a bit in surprise, but as she stares at her injury, many ideas come to mind. Suddenly&mdash; as if she had thought of something merry&mdash; she energetically cleans up the mess, somewhat in a rush. Then, she checks her calendar, and internally marks Friday with a circle. Her lips form into a scheming smile, she goes upstairs to brush her teeth and get ready for bed.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She slept peacefully that night knowing that the next few days would be of her enjoyment.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The next day, she gave off the illusion that she completely set the issue aside. It was so that McNamara would calm down and not keep a close eye on her. And it seemed to work, they silently agreed that neither of them were to be in the same place. Throughout the day, Duke carefully thought out the order of actions she'll carry out in the future, completely neglecting her other responsibilities. She received some criticism for it&mdash; usually from the teachers&mdash; but she didn't take any of it into consideration. Nothing is going to ruin this for her, she'll make sure of it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">On Tuesday&mdash; after leaving school earlier than usual&mdash; she went ahead and cleaned out her basement and moved the clutter to the empty rooms upstairs. Luckily for her, she already has everything she needs for her plan. A thick rope, a small bucket of water, a knife, some duct tape and a means for transportation. After a few hours, everything was in place and ready to accommodate her soon-to-be housemate. In the same afternoon, she drove and parked near an alleyway, in the more dismal part of town, where the illegal activities take place. There, she met a small group of young delinquents. The group contained five people, all of which were smoking and sitting on used boxes.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Upon catching sight of her, a boy who was seated in the middle spoke up. &ldquo;We don't care who you are. Make it quick, missy. What do you want?&rdquo; He said.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">With the way he acted, Heather Duke assumed he was the leader. &ldquo;I have a job you can do.&rdquo; She simply replied.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What job?&rdquo; The kid rose up and walked towards her. He was rather short, so she wasn't intimidated by his figure.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I want you to throw rocks at the McNamara&rsquo;s house. That's all you have to do, just throw rocks. You don't have to break anything, just cause some trouble.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You mean the mansion that has a huge fountain?&rdquo; Duke nodded her head in response. The kid squinted at her thoughtfully.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;How much are you going to pay us?&rdquo; He asked.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;$10,000.&rdquo; She answered, pulling out a box that contained the money.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Deal!&rdquo; He said without any hesitance&mdash; or seemingly any thought&mdash; and shook her hand. She gives him the box and watches him run to his friends and open it. They were thrilled, as she had expected. The members were a bunch of kids whose families were in tight situations. Considering that she needed a bit of help, she thought she'd take advantage of that.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The leader then turned away from the group and walked back to her. &ldquo;When do we start?&rdquo; He asks in a low tone and a trembling lip, hiding his joy.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;1pm today.&rdquo; She replies. He nods his head, going back to his group and probably telling them what they need to do.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She left the alleyway and drove back home, satisfied with the progress that she had made today. She can always catch up with school tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Night comes and she prepares to go drive to McNamara's house. She wore an all black outfit with some gloves and hit the road. She parked her Jeep far away so as to not seem suspicious. As she stepped on their lawn, she noticed a bunch of rocks abnormally placed on the ground. A mess caused by the kids she paid earlier. Before anything else, she goes through the potted plant near their door and sticks her hand in, after feeling around she eventually gets ahold of a key-like object and pulls it out. She pockets the key and picks up a rock, going to manoeuvre around the mansion. Trying to find the window to McNamara&rsquo;s room.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She immediately spots it and throws the rock, shattering her window. She didn't concern herself with the noise, knowing that McNamara is a heavy sleeper, while her mom is most likely too drunk to even check. They don't have any good relations with their neighbors, they hardly have any. Most of the houses down the street were unoccupied, only the rich lived in their area.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She scaled the walls of the mansion, entering through the broken window, and trying not to cut herself. Duke carefully walks over to her desk and searches for any papers that might contain McNamara's handwriting; she pulls out a small flashlight to illuminate her surroundings. She decides to take one of her old English notebooks, if she's lucky, McNamara will assume that she had just misplaced it, or not notice that it's gone at all. She tries her best to keep quiet on her way down, and leaves the property.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">On Wednesday, she notices McNamara behaving abnormally. She has a stressed look on her face, which Duke assumed was the result of discovering her broken window. Throughout the day, she closely watches her run around like some rat, her movements more panicked. Even though she stared at her longer than normal, it seemed like McNamara was too occupied to notice. It was kind of entertaining, her lips would form into a smile every time she saw her trip. And she&rsquo;d giggle whenever she heard her stutter when answering a teacher.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She could tell she was getting more agitated as each hour passed. The perspiration covering her face, her lips parting slightly to control her breathing, and her shaking hands that she tries to hide by clenching her fists. She wasn't sure if McNamara knew it or not, but Duke had studied her enough when they were still together. She'd look for signs of uncomfortability and use it to her advantage. It always gave her the upper hand during intense fights.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">After school, she spent her time imitating her handwriting, which was a challenge for her, since the letters are all so closely packed together, which made it hard to read. Many attempts later, she successfully wrote a note that looks believable enough.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">In that note, it read: &ldquo;Hey mom, I&rsquo;m staying over at a friend's house this weekend.&rdquo; McNamara always wrote notes like this whenever she'd come over at her house. If it works&mdash; which Duke is certain it would&mdash; her mom won't suspect anything wrong. And if she continues to disappear for longer than what was written in the note, she&rsquo;ll just assume that she had run away, as by that point, she had already packed most of McNamara's things. She won't do any move to find her, it&rsquo;d be too much trouble for her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo; She praised herself. She set the note aside and threw away all her failed ones. Duke yawns, only then realising that it's almost time for bed. She dreams of good things that night, things she couldn't remember, but she woke up in a good mood the next day, so she assumed she must've dreamt well.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Thursday was her rest day. A little break from all that she has done this week. She felt giddy for tomorrow, like a child waiting for Christmas. She made sure she had a good night's sleep.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">And now, she's here. Almost done with her plan. She felt proud of herself for managing to do this. Duke decides that it's time to get the luggage&mdash; that contained McNamara&rsquo;s necessities and clothes&mdash; and put it somewhere in her house. She goes upstairs, securely closing the door behind her. Just in case.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">After 2 hours, Heather McNamara finally regains consciousness. She blinked slowly as her eyes adjusted to the light, everything seemed to be a swirl. As her vision cleared, a mysterious pain stabbed at her head. She groans in pain, confused. She looks around her, immediately realizing that she has no idea where she is. There was a table beside her with nothing on it, some boxes that were stacked in a corner, stairs that seemed to go up, and a light bulb that barely illuminated the room. Alarms begin to blare in her head, she frantically darts her eyes to every part of the room, as if something she could use would magically appear.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Where am I?!&rdquo; She thought to herself as she saw her arms and legs had been tied to the chair. Her mouth has tape on it as well. She tries to thrash around to maybe loosen the restraints but barely makes any progress, all that did was amplify her peculiar headache. The ropes are dangerously tight, so she can't slip out of it without any tools. She groans and winces in pain as her head begins to hurt and her sight blurred. She can't seem to recall anything, she tries to calm down and think.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I was just at the parking lot when&mdash; Fuck! I can't remember!&rdquo; Her heartbeat rings in her ears, and she starts to breathe heavily. Everything seemed to darken around her. Her chest starts to ache.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What's going to happen to me?&rdquo; She asks herself, unsure if she wants the answer. She sharply inhales. She refused to accept the situation, hoping that this was all some stupid bad dream that was caused by her paranoia.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">A few minutes later&mdash; after more panicked silence&mdash; she hears footsteps that started to get louder as seconds went by. She feels herself start to shake as she gazes at the staircase in suspense, that must be her kidnapper. She hears a door open, and light shines through, but hope is not waiting for her on the other side. The light retires, and someone walks down the stairs. Each step echoed in the room.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">It's Heather Duke, she quickly recognized her. She stares at her with widened eyes. Her whole figure was eventually in her line of view, and Duke notices that she's awake. McNamara squints at her hands. She held a bucket, a towel and a knife.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You're awake, just in time.&rdquo; She smiles. McNamara wanted to ask her why she's here, but couldn't with the tape on her mouth. She sets down the things she had brought, and McNamara shudders at the sight of the knife. Duke dumps the towel in water and squeezed out the excess.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Hold still.&rdquo; She instructs. She wipes down McNamara's face with the towel, she catches a glimpse of it and notices that it&rsquo;s stained with blood. "I think I went a little bit too far." She comments as she continues&mdash; for lack of a better term&mdash; taking care of her.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She tossed the towel on the table and as soon as she did so, Duke slapped her across the face. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for hitting me.&rdquo; She says, staring her down.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara glares at her&mdash; and seeing it&mdash; her lips form into a grin. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me like that, it&rsquo;s only fair.&rdquo; She begins to circle her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not mad at you though. I kind of liked it. Call me weird or whatever, I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; She laughs. McNamara knits her eyebrows, stunned. Despite being in a dimly lit room, she could see a faint blush spread across her cheeks. Her face turns in disgust. Then, as if Duke&rsquo;s mood were a wheel, her face softens into an apologetic frown.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I know that I kind of agreed that we&rsquo;d break up, but honestly? I didn&rsquo;t think it through, I was too mad. I&rsquo;m really sorry about that.&rdquo; She kneels down to her eye level. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a bitch, Heather, but I really do love you. I mean&mdash; look! I did all this just for you!&rdquo; She stands up and gestures at the whole room, as if it would prove something. "I don't care how much we fight, Heather. You can burn every book I own and I&rsquo;d still forgive you."&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;But obviously I did something wrong since you thought of breaking up with me. I&rsquo;m sorry I made you feel like I didn&rsquo;t love you, so to make up for it I decided I&rsquo;d give you something&hellip; You know, I thought about it for a while, and I've decided!&rdquo; She watches her pick up the knife from the table. McNamara pleads with her eyes, what she was going to do was still a mystery to her, but she knew that it&rsquo;s nothing good.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, it won&rsquo;t hurt when I&rsquo;m done.&rdquo; Duke smiled at her, and she felt as if she was being mocked. She adjusts the rope that holds one of her arms down, pushing it towards her elbow. Duke rolled up her sleeve, there were lines of red because of the rope. McNamara frantically shakes her head and muffled out &ldquo;no&rdquo;, begging her to stop.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke looks her in the eye, expression flat. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do anything to stop me, so stop trying. I don&rsquo;t know why you&rsquo;re so scared, I thought you&rsquo;d be used to this sort of stuff.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She caresses the tip of the knife down the length of her arm, making sure to run it over her scars. The action only served to give McNamara a hint of how sharp the knife is.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; She asked, but McNamara was sure that she wouldn't care about her response. She turns the knife blade side down and in one swift move she makes the first cut. McNamara shut her eyes and tears poured down her cheeks. Blood flowed out of her sliced flesh. Duke continues to sloppily cut through her skin, she felt like she was getting dissected, not for research but for sport. Was she not in distress had she stopped shaking and crying, as Duke was having a hard time controlling her knife properly. It caused her to go over the same spot multiple times, deepening her wounds.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Maybe I should have used something smaller&hellip;&rdquo; She could hear her murmur to herself. &ldquo;Stop moving. You're making this harder than it needs to be.&rdquo; She scolded. McNamara ignored her, she couldn't stop herself even if she wanted to. The sharp ache from her arm makes her whole body convulse. Duke sunk the blade deeper in her flesh with each stroke, with the amount of blood she could feel flowing out, she was sure she would pass out later.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The tape muffled her agonized screams. She thrashed and moved about, but no movement she can do will break the ropes that held her. Despite her clear signs of distress, Duke didn't slow her hand, she instead held her arm down in an attempt to keep her still, pressing down hard enough that she felt like her bone was going to fracture. Her heart beat loudly in her chest, overpowering the low grunts Duke would let out whenever she'd flinch and shiver.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;It's done.&rdquo; She hears her say. McNamara wailed, the wounds stung and her skin froze. &ldquo;Open your eyes.&rdquo; Duke orders. She refused. The last thing she wants is to see it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Come on. I worked so hard on it, and you just kept shaking and crying too! I had to adjust!&rdquo; McNamara doesn't listen to her, only continuing to sob. Duke wasn't satisfied with her response, so she put her thumbs over her eyelids and forced them open to look down at her work.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara could only stare in horror as she saw on her arm&mdash; a carving of her name&mdash; &ldquo;Heather&rdquo;. The blood&mdash; that almost coated her entire arm&mdash; made it almost impossible to see the etching. Beads of blood rolled down the sides of her appendage. At some cuts she could see her dermis peeking through, as if Duke had the thought of amputating her limb. She wanted to vomit at the grizzly sight. She breaks out of Duke's grip, not wanting to look at it for any longer.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Genius, right? Every time you look at it you'll think of me!&rdquo; She chuckles in a mocking tone. McNamara looks her in the eyes, no hint of remorse can be found. Only a gleeful and somewhat lustful gaze, she wasn&rsquo;t sure if it was her distress or her blood that aroused her, but it might as well be both. Duke turns away from her, putting down the knife and dumping the towel in water. She brings the towel to her arm and cleans it of blood, though it still continues to flow out. She cleans the knife as well, humming an unidentifiable tune as McNamara wept silently in her chair.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke goes back to her, holding the knife. She rolls up her own sleeves, bringing the blade to her arm. But before she does anything, she stares into her eyes.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;In case you still don&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo; McNamara doesn&rsquo;t look away when Duke starts carving out her name. Her eyes fixated on how the knife cuts into her skin with ease, blood flowing out of each and every slash she makes, some dripping down and forming a small puddle on the floor. It&rsquo;s a disturbing sight to witness, yet for some reason it isn't enough to make McNamara turn away. She held her breath as the liquid started to smell metallic and pungent. Her swift movements were almost mesmerising to her, her eyes following the crimson hand that held the knife.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her gaze wanders to Duke&rsquo;s face; she doesn&rsquo;t show any signs of pain or agony, if anything, she looks like she&rsquo;s enjoying doing this. It made her sick. She doesn't bother wiping off the red fluid when she puts her hands on McNamara's cheeks with a crushing grip.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;We're matching.&rdquo; She says, grinning. She wanted to push her off, anything to keep her from getting close. &ldquo;I don't care how many times you hit me, insult me, or whatever the fuck. I'll always be here.&rdquo; Leaning closer, Duke hugs her. It felt suffocating, even though her grip wasn't tight, it was a reminder of how she's trapped, and how nobody's coming to save her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I brought your clothes with me, I already got some of your favourites ready on our bed. You don't need to think about school, I'll teach you whatever we learned that day, but I'm sure you're not too concerned about that right now. You don't need to worry about your health either. I'll do everything, cook&hellip; clean, all that boring stuff. I also have a few gym equipment upstairs, I know you like working out. You can use the TV when you're bored and I'm not around. What I'm trying to say is: don't sweat, I have everything you need. Just don't try to escape, and I won't do anything bad. I know it may look scary, but it won't be if you behave, okay?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Heather Duke slowly withdraws from her. &ldquo;Hold still.&rdquo; She quietly tells her. McNamara is confused for a moment until Duke suddenly rips the tape off her mouth, screeching in pain. She inhales sharply, taking in the scent of the blood, she immediately gags. Duke grabs the bucket and quickly throws out the cold water onto the floor, holding it just below her face.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She pukes, making horribly loud squelching sounds. She felt Duke moving away her hair to stop it from getting dirty. Eventually, she empties her stomach, spitting out what remains in her mouth. She breathes heavily through her mouth.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Eugh!&rdquo; She could hear Duke exclaim. &ldquo;Don't worry, I'll clean you up.&rdquo; She kisses her forehead and quickly jogs upstairs. McNamara didn't curse her out like she had wanted to, maybe because she's exhausted, or maybe there's no point to it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She's alone with her thoughts, together with the pulsating pain that was slowly starting to feel numb as minutes went by. She stares blankly at the floor, blood and water covers its surface. She doesn't know how to get out, or how long she&rsquo;ll stay here. For all she knows it'll be a year until she'll even have the opportunity. The uncertainty terrifies her, she&rsquo;ll have no autonomy for more than she's comfortable for. She doesn't want to accept it, but what other choice does she have? If she tries to escape then she'll just get tortured to satisfy Duke's sick fantasies.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She sits and waits until Heather Duke comes back, and the moment she brings her upstairs with her hands still tied, is she sure that none of this is a dream.</p>
