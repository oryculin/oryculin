            <a href="../fanfictions.html">Back to content list</a>
            <p dir="ltr">It has been about a month since Heather McNamara asked Heather Duke to be her girlfriend. She said yes, but she acts like she hasn't. McNamara told herself that maybe she just felt awkward, that she&rsquo;s not used to being in a relationship yet. But she noticed the way Duke would pretend to be paying attention to her, she&rsquo;d smile and tilt her head as if she hadn&rsquo;t been thinking about other matters. Every time McNamara said something affectionate, Duke would only respond with a nod. Sometimes she&rsquo;d kiss her on the cheek, but she didn&rsquo;t ever say anything back.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She never said it directly, but McNamara knew that she&rsquo;d have to earn it. She told herself that the idea was ridiculous, that all she needs to do is wait until Duke&rsquo;s comfortable. That she didn&rsquo;t need to do anything bold. But as the days dragged on, her patience wore thin.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Later after school late in the night, she waited until her parents left to have an argument disguised as a private dinner. She threw on her nicest night clothes, pretty enough for Duke to marvel at her, but casual enough to not seem desperate.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara goes to the bathroom, the one with two entrances, one door connects to her room, and the other connects to the hall. She grabs the sharpest razor she could find. She sets it aside on the sink and stares at herself in the mirror.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The first thing she does is wash her face, apply a little make-up. Then she fixes her hair, making sure that not even a strand seems out of place. A lump rises in her throat and her heart beats violently. Any amount of sense left her a long while ago, so she refused to check herself. She moves to grab the sink stopper to cover the drain.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She couldn&rsquo;t stop the trembling in her hands when she reached for the blade and held it to the anterior of her wrist. She gathers the courage to make the first cut, she makes it quick. It takes a while for the blood to appear, she almost thought she hadn&rsquo;t pressed the blade hard enough. It wasn&rsquo;t as painful as she thought it would be, it was more similar to a pinch rather than something more brutal.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">It gives her the confidence to make several more cuts along her skin, enough that it would produce a sufficient amount of blood for her to use as ink.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her hands had gone numb from the icy air when she finally let go of the blade. She didn&rsquo;t care to wash off the wounds, but she put her wrist up to her chest to prevent the blood from dripping onto the floor. She tries to collect herself, massaging her temple to fight the ache in her head. The bathroom reeked of a sharp, metallic smell. Once she regained her composure, she dipped a finger into the small pool of blood.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She starts to write something on the mirror, each stroke messier than the last. Her writing starts to become illegible by the time she writes the last word. But in spite of the pain, she adds a small heart at the end.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She retreats from the mirror a few paces then stares at the sentence. She catches sight of herself through the blood. Pale, hollow, and excited. McNamara leaves the bathroom with her wrist still bleeding. Her whole body trembled as she took the phone from its receiver and began dialing Duke&rsquo;s number.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Hello, who is this?&rdquo; asked Duke&rsquo;s voice from the other side.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara&rsquo;s voice came out as hoarse, shaky. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Heather.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What is it? I&rsquo;m a little busy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She knows that she&rsquo;s lying, but she doesn&rsquo;t try to argue with her. &ldquo;Please, come over. I have something I want you to see.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She hears a tired sigh. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t wait until tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No, it really can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Fine, I&rsquo;ll be over in a bit.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Duke ends the call first, she always does. McNamara sets the phone down and returns to the bathroom. She turned off all the lights and contented herself with waiting on the bathroom floor.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Heather Duke almost didn&rsquo;t come, but something about Heather McNamara's voice gave off a sense of desperation. She arrives at her door in less than thirty minutes, hoping that this would be quick. The call interrupted her sleep, and it isn't like her to break away from her routine. She knocks on the front door, then after a minute she presses her ear to the wood trying to hear for some footsteps.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She knocks again, accompanied by a yell this time. &ldquo;Heather? I&rsquo;m here!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Even so, no one answered her. Frustrated, Duke reaches for the doorknob and lets herself in. She doesn&rsquo;t step further beyond the door frame, none of the lights were on. &ldquo;Heather?&rdquo; she calls out.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke closes the door behind her and feels for the light switch in the dark. She turns on the lights for the living room and the ones above the stairs. If there was life in this house, they didn&rsquo;t make any indication that they were here.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She stood perplexed, scanning the room. &ldquo;Heather? Where are you?&rdquo; She clicks her tongue in annoyance and mutters to herself, &ldquo;What the hell is she up to?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She knows that she&rsquo;s here, she wouldn&rsquo;t have called her if she wasn&rsquo;t. Unless she got brave enough to play a joke on her, she has no reason to believe that she isn&rsquo;t somewhere in the house.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She climbs up the stairs and sees that the door to the bathroom is slightly ajar. The one next to McNamara&rsquo;s room. She hesitated to continue, the atmosphere seemed to darken as she got closer.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The door knob feels cold, but she forces herself to push it open. The first thing she notices is the smell. Raw, metallic. &ldquo;Holy shit&rdquo; &mdash; she mumbled to herself before raising her voice &mdash; &ldquo;Heather? Are you here?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She opens the light. Immediately she sees McNamara sitting on the floor, blood covering most of her wrist. Her back hunched over like somebody had shot her in the stomach, her eyes had a twinge of red, which she isn&rsquo;t sure was from crying, or from drugs. None of them say anything. Duke furrows her eyebrows, her pale lips part, but she fails to find the right words. She remained motionless, stunned at the sight before her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara gnawed at her lip as several thoughts and obscenities crashed into one another in her brain, she wanted her to say something. Duke slowly turned her gaze away from the girl and looked around the room. The sink had a small pool of red liquid in it, and on the mirror there was a simple sentence written in blood.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; it said.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke stares at it fixedly for a moment before looking back at McNamara with new eyes. The confusion she felt then melted into heat. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; she asks.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I&hellip;&rdquo; she hesitates, &ldquo;I thought that maybe you&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She hums, trying to discern whether to derive arousal or pity. &ldquo;What were you hoping for?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara averts her eyes in shame. She doesn&rsquo;t answer her question, but her silence is enough. A grin appears on Duke&rsquo;s face, she closes the door behind her, approaching the mirror. She reads the message again. &ldquo;A normal person would&rsquo;ve just written this in ink, you know.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She leans against the sink and crosses her arms &ldquo;I'll be honest with you, when you asked me to be your girlfriend, I only said yes to shut you up. I knew you wouldn't leave me alone about it. Never really liked you that way.&rdquo; She shrugs her shoulders.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;... What?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Hey, don&rsquo;t take it to heart. You only begged me because I was your only choice, right? You were lonely.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara quickly shakes her head. &ldquo;No, Heather I &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;At least, that&rsquo;s what I thought before this,&rdquo; she interrupted, &ldquo; I thought you were boring, just another slut using someone as a rebound.&rdquo; Duke covers a part of her mouth as she laughs. &ldquo;I was wrong. Heather, you proved me wrong. And I didn&rsquo;t even need to ask you to.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara watches her dip a finger into the blood and hold it up to her nose to smell it. A pleased sigh escapes Duke&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s real,&rdquo; her merriment only grew. She kneels down to McNamara&rsquo;s level.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She tries averting her gaze again but Duke&rsquo;s hand finds her cheek. &ldquo;This is way better than you saying it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">A delicate flush lit her face. &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather, I love it.&rdquo; Duke grabs her hand, admiring the open cuts and the active bleeding. She kisses one of the wounds, creating a thin coat of blood on her lips. &ldquo;Tell me, what do you want from me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I want you to say it.&rdquo; She needn&rsquo;t specify, Duke already knows what she&rsquo;s talking about.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She kisses her cheek, and for a moment McNamara is disappointed. &ldquo;I love you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">A soft smile starts to emerge. &ldquo;I love you too.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke gently let go of her hand only to seize her by the hair, yanking her head back. McNamara gasped, breath hitching. But she didn&rsquo;t resist, letting herself be claimed. The kiss crashed into her, fierce and violent. She tastes the blood, she hates how it makes her whimper.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her fingers clutched Duke&rsquo;s shirt, dragging her closer. Frustration twists inside of her, electric and thrilling. Why did she have to hurt herself for Duke to say it? The thought should sicken her, but finally hearing it from her own mouth, it ignited something reckless.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Their hips collided as Duke pulled her down to the cold tile floor. McNamara shivered, but Duke was already on her, forcing her chin up, teeth grazing skin. Her lips found McNamara&rsquo;s throat, sinking her teeth just deep enough to hurt.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her breath feels hot against her skin. &ldquo;Have you done this before or am I the first?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The first and the last.&rdquo; She quivers when she feels Duke&rsquo;s hand slide up her shirt.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Good. I want it to stay that way.&rdquo; She presses one last kiss to her forehead before pulling away. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your bandages? I&rsquo;ll help you clean up.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara points at the medicine cabinet hidden away behind the mirror. For the rest of the night, Duke stayed to treat her wounds and patch her up. She cleans the mess in the bathroom, though she did borrow her instant camera to snap a photo of the scene first. She wasn&rsquo;t able to stay in for the night, Duke&rsquo;s parents would contact hers and they&rsquo;d be in trouble. But Duke made sure to bring her flowers with a note that has her lipstick mark on it the next day of school.</p>
