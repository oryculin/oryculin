            <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
            <h4>Options</h4>
            <a href="../lymchapters.html">Back to chapter list</a>
            <a href="../../fanfictions.html">Back to content list</a>
            <p dir="ltr">Heather McNamara has three options in mind, those being: Kurt Kelly, Ram Sweeney, and Heather Chandler. She'd rather ask someone who she knows and somewhat likes. Well, in the case of Kurt and Ram, she only tolerates them, but she added them in her list anyway, since they'll likely agree without thinking anything of it. Even though her father specifically told her to find a man &mdash; and is probably expecting her to whether or not he specified &mdash; she could easily convince him that he said nothing of the kind, so she decided to put Heather Chandler on her list.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The plan is simple and was clearly thought of on the spot, go up to them and then ask if they'd like to form an arrangement. Have it done before school ends. She might beg or guilt them, but she'll only do that when she needs it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">A little before lunch starts, we have Heather McNamara fix her gaze at Ram Sweeney from her desk. He's sitting just across from her.&nbsp; She takes a moment to wonder if asking him is a good idea. Then she realises that it's either this or getting married to some geezer who's been around since the flood, both are undesirable, but the better option is clear.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Just get this over with already.&rdquo; She whispers to herself. After all, she thought, she doesn't have all the time in the world to keep second guessing.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The bell rings, it&rsquo;s time for lunch. McNamara stands up and approaches Ram before he could dash out of the room.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Hi Ram.&rdquo; She says to get his attention. He grins at the sight of her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Hey pretty face.&rdquo; Ram put his hands on her hips without a warning or permission.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara quickly pushes him away, unable to hide her disgust. He playfully frowns. &ldquo;Awe, babe, don&rsquo;t be like that!&rdquo; He tries going near her again, but McNamara holds her arm out to prevent him from getting any closer.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Don't touch me, you're sweaty.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Sweaty? Psh!&rdquo; He gestures at his body and laughs. &ldquo;I'm as fresh as fresh can get!&rdquo; McNamara rolls her eyes, recalling why she doesn&rsquo;t ever bother talking to him. But she forces a smile on her face anyway.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Ram, you&rsquo;re rich, right?&rdquo; She raises an eyebrow, inching closer to him. Ram does the same.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yeah, what do you want? I&rsquo;ll get it for you, just as long as I get something in return.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I want to ask you something, but promise me you won't tell anyone.&rdquo; She says, holding up her pinky finger.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Nothing can make me hate you, sweetheart.&rdquo; Ram hooks his own finger with hers.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; She pouts and crosses her arms. She looks around to see if anyone&rsquo;s watching or listening in, and seeing no one, she leans into his ear.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Kurt&rsquo;s just been so boring these days.&rdquo; She whispers.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh yeah?&rdquo; Ram whispers back, a flirty look on his face.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo; she puts her hand on his chest, &ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re so much better.&rdquo; She slowly moves her hand down his torso. &ldquo;You know what I want.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Hell yeah I do.&rdquo; He puts his hands on her hips. &ldquo;Ditch that loser. Tell me what you want me to do. I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yeah, come on.&rdquo; He replies.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Alright, if you're so sure. Why don't you marry me? We'd make a good fit, don't you agree?&rdquo; Hearing this, Ram&rsquo;s face dropped into an awkward smile, he waited for her to follow it up with a laugh, but McNamara stared at him earnestly.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Huh? Seriously?&rdquo; His hands leave her body and he scratches the back of his head. McNamara frowned, not expecting his reaction.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? You said you'd do anything.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">He laughs. &ldquo;Is this a joke? Or are you acting? &lsquo;Cause I can't tell, like is this some sort of kink?&rdquo;</p>
            <p>He laughs. &ldquo;Is this a joke? Or are you acting? &lsquo;Cause I can't tell, like is this some sort of kink?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">It felt embarrassing, but she clarified herself. &ldquo;No, I'm asking you seriously, Ram. Do you wanna get married to me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">He tilts his head, narrowing his eyes at her. &ldquo;I still can't tell.&rdquo; He said after a long delay.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">It was clear to her that Ram was acting dumb to annoy her so much that she'd drop the subject, or maybe he just really couldn't tell.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'm not joking. My parents want me to find a guy to marry when I turn twenty.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Gotta be more clearer than that, &lsquo;cause&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Maybe try saying no when you don't wanna do something.&rdquo; She interrupted, sighing in disappointment. &ldquo;Forget about this, I'm gonna go.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No, wait, I'm into it! It's totally hot when women try to trap me in a marriage!&rdquo; Ram shouted, still hoping to get her to hook up with him. McNamara doesn't spare him a glance and heads outside the classroom. She starts to walk down the hallway to the cafeteria. The conversation left her feeling slightly bitter, but she had her doubts anyway, so she got over it quickly. She spots Heather Chandler waiting by the lockers and approaches her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Alright, lay it on me.&rdquo; Chandler said as McNamara stood by her. &ldquo;Who got you all pissy this time?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; She furrowed her brows.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I can tell you're pissed, now tell me what's wrong.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara grunts and slumps her shoulders. &ldquo;My parents are making me choose someone to marry, and if I don&rsquo;t they&rsquo;ll kick me out of the house.&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;they think I can't run their stupid jewelry business.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She blinks before replying. &ldquo;No. But why do I have to get married? They can just hire one of my cousins or something.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;It hasn't even been a week since your birthday.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;That's what I thought! But my dad said that he needs to talk to family like &mdash; immediately!&rdquo; She emphasized the italicised words.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Chandler pauses for a moment then shrugs her shoulders. &ldquo;At least they&rsquo;re giving you a choice.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her words made McNamara think back to the night before, and it almost immediately soured her mood.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;That doesn't fucking matter!&rdquo; She bellowed, kicking the locker beside her. She doesn&rsquo;t know why anybody just couldn&rsquo;t get it. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wanna do this!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;A few students turned their heads to look at them, but they quickly continued on with their business when they saw who likely made the noise.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Chandler stepped away from her in surprise. &ldquo;Alright, okay, I get it.&rdquo; She put her hands up defensively. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to scream at me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara&rsquo;s face softened in regret, she didn&rsquo;t mean to yell. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m just so stressed. They want me to find someone by Friday this week.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well, is there at least someone who you wanna ask?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yeah, three actually. I crossed one out just a while ago.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She broke eye contact with her out of embarrassment. &ldquo;Ram.&rdquo; She grumbled.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Him?&rdquo; Chandler stared in disbelief. &ldquo;You're already that desperate?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Who else do I ask?&rdquo; She doesn't give much time for Chandler to reply before continuing. &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo; McNamara crosses her arms. &ldquo;Let's go to the bathrooms, I don't wanna talk about it out here.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Chandler held back a sigh. &ldquo;Alright, whatever.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">They made their way to the bathrooms and kicked out the girls who were already there. It was rude, but they didn't concern themselves with it. They checked the stalls and made sure none of them were occupied before locking the door.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara inhaled sharply, averting her gaze from Chandler. &ldquo;Okay, don't freak out on me.&rdquo; She starts, and hesitates before saying: &ldquo;But you're on my list too.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">There was a long pause, then Chandler furrowed her eyebrows, stepping away from her.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You're joking.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Does it look like I am?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Chandler shoots her a glare. &ldquo;Unlock the fucking door.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She felt offended, but figured she shouldn't get so mad at her because she'd probably react the same. &ldquo;Ugh, I don't like you like that! It's just&mdash; okay fine, I'm just desperate, alright? If you don't agree then Kurt&rsquo;s my last chance, and I&rsquo;m sure as hell that he won't be any different from Ram!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Look, even if I swing that way, there's no way my parents will let me. It doesn't matter if you're rich or not, they'll kill me!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;So you don't want to?&rdquo; She blinks a few times to get a tear out of her eye and forces her voice to crack. &ldquo;Because if you don't&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She quickly interrupts her in a dismissive tone. &ldquo;That's not gonna work on me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What? Come on!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather, don't fucking act like you wouldn't say no too!&rdquo; Chandler goes up to the door, unlocking it. &ldquo;If we get married, we're both dead! Me because my parents are gonna think I'm some gross muff-diver, and you because I'll end up beating you to death for ruining my reputation! I'm going to the cafeteria&mdash;&rdquo; she opens the door &ldquo;&mdash; go try your luck with Kurt or something, I don't know.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well what other choice do I have?&rdquo; She muttered, but didn't intend for Chandler to hear it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">They walked towards the entrance of the cafeteria. This was more challenging than she had thought. She isn't very confident, but she hoped that Kurt would find it in him to say yes to her. If not, then she&rsquo;ll find herself in quandary. She might have to start asking all the boys at school, she has a better chance at finding a partner that way. She isn't happy with that idea though. What will people say about her? She didn't want to imagine it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Chandler and McNamara sat down at the very centre of the cafeteria, a place reserved for just the Heathers. They didn't even have to intimidate anyone to keep them away from the table, everyone just seemed to agree that it should be exclusive to them. Whether it's to avoid a scolding, or done out of admiration and respect, it's not certain.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Heather Duke, their friend, was already sitting down at the table, looking bored and irritated. Usually she'd just look bored.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh, you guys are early today. Lunch hasn&rsquo;t even started yet.&rdquo; She sneered, glaring at the other two, unhappy that they had her wait for so long. She greatly cared for her image and thought that sitting alone made her look like a loser. &ldquo;What happened to the &ldquo;no coming to the cafeteria later than five minutes&rdquo; rule? Or does that only apply to me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Shut up Heather,&rdquo; Chandler scowled, &ldquo;something came up. What, you can't wait for more than five minutes?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke returned the foul look but didn't try to argue with her. &ldquo;Sorry Heather.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara stayed quiet. She didn't care much for their bickering, her eyes scanned her surroundings until they had caught sight of Kurt Kelly. He was sitting at a table adjacent to theirs, talking to his friends. She didn't bother excusing herself to go approach Kurt.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Chandler and Duke watch her speak to him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s she doing?&rdquo; Duke questioned, tilting her head and staring at them.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Talking to him, what else does it look like?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I have no idea.&rdquo; Duke rolled her eyes and turned her head away from the two, going back to mindlessly staring at the lunch table, waiting until the bell rings.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara tapped Kurt&rsquo;s shoulder and he swiftly turned around to face her. He immediately wraps an arm around her waist and pulls her close. His friends hollered at the sight and made disgusting noises.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Hey, what's up?&rdquo; He asked, grinning.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She forces a smile and reluctantly hooks an arm around him. &ldquo;I need to talk to you in private, Kurt.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh, Kurt&rsquo;s in trouble!&rdquo; Shouted one of the people at the table.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Shut the fuck up!&rdquo; Kurt playfully replied, he faces McNamara again and he looks excited. &ldquo;Let's get out of here babe.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">They walk away from the crowd, Kurt&rsquo;s arm still wrapped around her waist. She could smell his ghastly sweat and held in the urge to gag or wince.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;So, where are we heading?&rdquo; He asks once they got to the hallway.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;The Science lab maybe, I don't know.&rdquo; She shrugged her shoulders. They made their way to the lab, shutting the door behind them. Kurt finally let her go, McNamara breathed out a suppressed sigh of relief and made a mental note to immediately wash her blazer later.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Did you actually want to talk or was there something else?&rdquo; He gazes at her with a knowing look, stepping closer to her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I want to talk.&rdquo; She replied.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; his smile drops into a frown, &ldquo;well what is it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara hesitates for a moment, not sure how to ask him without it being too much to digest. She twirls around a strand of her hair and talks to him in a soft tone. &ldquo;So, my parents want me to choose who I want to marry, and who else would I ask except for you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;no thanks.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; McNamara stared at him in disbelief. &ldquo;But we've been dating for like&mdash;&rdquo; she briefly paused to count &ldquo;&mdash;two years!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yeah but I thought we were just saying that because it made us look good!&rdquo; And he was right, but McNamara wanted an excuse to make him agree to marrying her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What, so all that forever talk was just a lie then? You're a fucking joke, Kurt!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Did your dad kick you out or something? You're just asking me that &lsquo;cause you wanna leech off my cash!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Cash? What cash, Kurt? Your dad is six months behind on bills!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Kurt seems to ignore the retort. &ldquo;You whore around every other week and now you want me to buy a ring?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Like you don't do that too! Hell, you've had sex for more times than that girl &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know her name &mdash; from one of your parties!&rdquo; She argues. She had long forgotten her reason for bringing him here.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;It doesn't matter! I'm a guy, it's different!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara scoffed. &ldquo;Don't get surprised when your dick looks all shriveled and used up, girls know what that looks like.&rdquo; She wasn't really sure if dicks could shrivel, but all she could care about is the satisfaction she felt when Kurt&rsquo;s eyes widened.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Say that again you bitch! I'll punch your teeth in and use your blood as the lube when I fuck the shit out of you!&rdquo; He clenches his fists, stepping closer to her. She moves away from him from fright, but that didn&rsquo;t stop her from snapping back.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What the hell did you just say to me?! Fuck you Kurt, I hope your dick goes limp!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara quickly runs to the door, she has definitely pushed her luck. She closes the door behind her, her heartbeat spiking in fear. Before Kurt could run after, she headed off to the cafeteria. Perspiration covered her face as she went over to sit down with Chandler and Duke.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke, who had hung her head in boredom before, now looked at McNamara with genuine curiosity. &ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; She asks, noticing how McNamara was catching her breath.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara was about to tell her, but decided against it. &ldquo;Kurt's just being a dick again.&rdquo; She said, withholding the details.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She squints at her for a quick second before saying: &ldquo;Oh, well okay.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Chandler then began rambling on about unimportant matters, gossip, scandals, and all the like. McNamara listened in from time to time but her mind was set on other things. She silently despaired about where to go from now. She has too much pride to ask anyone in school and too much fear to go for the men on the list. And she has to hope she doesn&rsquo;t end up on the news the next time she bumps into Kurt. There has to be someone else she hasn't considered yet, she just needs some more time to think!</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather!&rdquo; Her thinking was cut short by Chandler shouting her name.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; She flinched in surprise. &ldquo;You can talk without yelling at me, y&rsquo;know!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Whatever, are you coming to the party tomorrow? Kurt told me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara loudly grouses to interrupt her, not caring if it pisses her off. &ldquo;Heather, we always go to parties, can't we just take a break or something?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I agree.&rdquo; Duke chimed in.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Chandler found herself being in the minority, and not a convincing argument or threat shot through her mind to respond with. &ldquo;Since when did you guys get so lame?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'm not going.&rdquo; McNamara said.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara glares at her as if to say: &ldquo;Heather, I have a lot going on right now, I don&rsquo;t have time to go to another shitty party.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Chandler recognizes the look and lets out a low, disgruntled noise. She doesn't say anything else.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'm not going if Heather isn't.&rdquo; Duke said, unaware of the silent message and using this as an opportunity to make better use of her weekend.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Fine, I'll let you guys off for now, but next time you better make sure you two are going!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The bell finally rings. The Heathers went their separate ways, going to their respective classes. Duke briefly pulled McNamara aside to thank her for not agreeing to go to the party. She didn&rsquo;t really know what to respond with, so she stayed silent and went on with her way. McNamara let her problems rest for a moment, she'd have to think about it when she isn't being disrupted by her teachers or classmates.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, at her house, her parents are doing things parents should do. Their helpers are on vacation, so they have to do all the housework themselves. Her mother is cleaning the floors while her father is washing the dishes, he usually wouldn't do any of the chores, as he always uses his stress and anger as an excuse. So his wife looked at him with scepticism while she dusted off the bookshelves in the living room.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Anything you're looking forward to this week?&rdquo; She asked, seeing as he's done with washing the dishes and is now picking up his newspaper.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'm waiting for some good news today.&rdquo; He said, a smile across his round face.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What good news?&rdquo; She knits her brows.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'm expecting Heather to tell us that she hasn't found someone yet.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;And how can you be so sure?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">He scoffs, fixing his newspaper in order to read it properly. &ldquo;Are you running on decaf today? It's obvious, how can she find a man in such little time?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;And how much time did you give her?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I was generous. She has until Friday this week.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She shook her head dubiously and turned on the television, sitting down on the couch to watch her favorite show. A few hours go by and they hear a knock outside, they aren&rsquo;t expecting any visitors today, so they know that it&rsquo;s Heather on the other side.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Here she is.&rdquo; He smiles in merriment and puts down the newspaper. His wife turns down the volume of the television in order to both hear them talk and watch the show.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Give us the news, Heather.&rdquo; He said.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara scratches the back of her neck. &ldquo;There's no one yet.&rdquo; She reveals after a short interval of silence.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well that's okay, isn't it? If you don't find anyone by then, you still have the list to choose from!&rdquo; He laughed.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara could feel his jeers saturating her in bile. She clenches her jaw, she couldn't think of anything to answer him with except for a string of curses and swears. With rage stabbing her heart, she held her peace and headed off to her room.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She sits on the edge of her bed and begins to think of her next move. If she can't bring herself to ask someone from her own school, she'll have to look elsewhere. They're less likely to recognise her, so she won't have to worry much about her image. If she's lucky, she'll have no trouble finding someone who doesn't mind. Chandler could help her with that, she's sure.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She considers the idea, meditating about it for a while before coming to a conclusion, it's probably her best option as of now. She goes to her desk and reaches for her contacts notebook, she opens up to a page where she lists down the numbers of a bunch of people she knows.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She puts the telephone to her ear and dials Heather Chandler&rsquo;s number. After about a minute, she picks up.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; Asked her voice through the receiver.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather, it's me, Heather. I need some help&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">"For what?"</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I was hoping you'd set me up with a bunch of guys so that I can get this stupid marriage thing over with.&rdquo; McNamara twists the coil cord of the telephone in her finger as she speaks.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh sure, what are you looking for?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Someone who's rich, I don't care if he's ugly. Make sure he&rsquo;s not too old.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Okay, by rich do you mean millionaire rich or just someone who has a dad that earns a couple thousand dollars every year?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Uh, I don't know, millionaire rich I guess?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh&hellip; that's going to be a little hard, give me three weeks.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara was quick to exclaim something in shock. &ldquo;Three weeks?! Heather, my dad wants me to have someone by Friday!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather, I can't do miracles, it's either that or you think of something else to do.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">"What if Heather helps you? Is it gonna speed things up?"</p>
            <p dir="ltr">"I don't know, probably? I doubt we're going to find a guy by Friday though.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">"Ugh&hellip; okay let's put it on hold for now. I'll think of another plan." After a long moment, an idea sparks, but McNamara is unsure of it, even so, she ventures to speak. "What if I ask Heather?"</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Ask her what?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;To marry me.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">There was a quick silence before Chandler replied. &ldquo;Are you dumb?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Is that a no?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">"I mean, go for it,&rdquo; she chortled in amusement, &ldquo;but not without praying that she doesn't spread some nasty rumours about you."</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Can I pay her to keep quiet about it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Maybe, but don't expect it to last long.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">"You're right. But like &mdash; it's worth a shot right? Who cares if she thinks I'm weird! If she goes around telling people about it, I can just say that she's being crazy right? Or I can turn it around and say that she's just being a bitch because I rejected her, or &mdash;"</p>
            <p dir="ltr">"Heather, I think you need some fresh air,&rdquo; Chandler interrupted, &ldquo;open a window or something, damn."</p>
            <p dir="ltr">"Yeah..&rdquo; McNamara brought a hand to her forehead and huffed. &ldquo;I guess I should go now, bye Heather.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Bye.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara places the telephone back on the hook switch and stashes her notebook away. She starts to think of ways on how to approach Heather Duke. Deep in her thoughts, she realises that she doesn't know that much about her, other than the fact that she's kind of a nerd and that her dad owes some money to hers.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">It&rsquo;ll be a dirty move, but she can use it to her advantage. She wonders how she should say it to her, should she give it to her as it is, or should she be a little bit vague at first? She can't predict her reaction, so it's not long until she hits a wall.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Fuck it, I'll just figure it out when I talk to her.&rdquo; McNamara goes to her bed and switches off the lights. She sleeps in a better mood compared to yesterday, even though she isn't really sure that Duke would take her offer. But even if she doesn't, she still has a plan she can turn to.</p>
