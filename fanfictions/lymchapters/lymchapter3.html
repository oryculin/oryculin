            <p>Heather McNamara had arrived earlier to school than usual. She knew that Heather Duke preferred to attend at an early hour, and McNamara didn't want anyone interrupting or listening in her conversation with her. She checks her watch, exactly five-thirty. The halls were barren, and she could hear the clicking her heels made everytime she took a step.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She stops her tracks right outside the Yearbook Club Room, she peeks through the small window of the door and spots Duke writing something on her notebook. She takes a deep breath and reluctantly knocks. Duke looks up to see who it was.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Upon recognising her, she nods her head as to say she can come in. McNamara finds herself trembling a bit before twisting the knob and entering.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Goodmorning Heather.&rdquo; She greeted her from the door frame, giving her a friendly smile.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Morning.&rdquo; Duke gave a curt reply, going back to focusing on what she was doing. McNamara awkwardly walked towards one of the chairs.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Is anyone sitting here?&rdquo; She asks in a somewhat timid voice.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No, not right now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She picks up the chair and moves it so that it&rsquo;s placed at the opposite side of the table Duke is sitting at. &ldquo;Can I sit here?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Duke narrows her eyes at her, a questioning stare. &ldquo;Do you have a mint?&rdquo; She asks, but McNamara could see that it wasn't the one she wanted to say.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh, yeah, here you go.&rdquo; McNamara quickly rummages through the pockets of her blazer and hands her a piece of mint. Duke takes it from her and begins writing in her notebook. McNamara could only watch her, unsure of how to start. She's starting to rethink this, considering excusing herself out and settling on the other plan.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke&rsquo;s voice breaks her out of her musings. &ldquo;Anything on your mind?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; McNamara stammered.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You're staring at me, it's weird.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh, uh &mdash; sorry.&rdquo; She feels blood rush to her head from the embarrassment. &ldquo;What are you working on there?&rdquo; She hastily says.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Homework.&rdquo; Duke answers, sounding disinterested.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; McNamara smiled, even though she wasn't looking at her, &ldquo;so how are you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">There was a long silence, McNamara was waiting for her to ask her the same question but she never does. She understood that she wouldn't be able to get her attention this way.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You're really pretty, you know.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Finally, Duke raises her head, seemingly seconds away from telling her to leave her alone. &ldquo;Sorry, but do you need something from me? If you're trying to sell me something, I'm not interested.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She was quick to deny it. &ldquo;No, I'm not!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Okay, so what is it then? Are you into me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; McNamara exclaims. &ldquo;But I do need something from you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Alright,&rdquo; Duke puts down her pen and closes her notebook, &ldquo;tell me then.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Uh&hellip;&rdquo; She hesitates, and Duke stares at her impatiently. &ldquo;Sorry, there's no easy way to say this.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Don't waste my time, Heather.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Right, so have you ever thought about getting married?&rdquo; The question was direct, personal, and could've been worded better. But she doesn't seem to mind.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke shook her head. &ldquo;If you want dating advice, I'm not the person to talk to.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No, no, I just want an answer.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She hums thoughtfully. &ldquo;I guess whenever my parents bring it up, I do.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Do you ever plan to?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Not really.&rdquo; Duke shrugged her shoulders.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh&mdash; okay, do you think you'll change your mind when you're older? T-twenty, maybe?&rdquo; She started to speak with haste, making her stumble over her words.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke furrowed her eyebrows in confusion. &ldquo;What? What are you trying to say?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'll explain later!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Okay, okay, no.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;W-what about this? What if someone rich asks you to marry them? L-like millionaire rich?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well&mdash;I mean, if I can tolerate them, then maybe?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara straightens her posture. &ldquo;Really? What about me?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke frowns and her eyebrows knit in disgust, but her silence lets McNamara know that she&rsquo;s willing to hear her explain herself.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the thing: my parents want me to choose someone to marry when I turn twenty. Trust me, I don't want to do this either. But it's that or I get married to a pedophile or I get thrown out of my house. We don't have to act lovey dovey and all that, you're free to see other people too. Just whenever nobody's looking.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Pedophile?&rdquo; Duke repeated, &ldquo;what?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Like fifty-plus year old guys that my parents want me to marry. They let me try to find someone before Friday.&rdquo; McNamara clarified.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke pressed her lips together and tapped her fingers on the table. &ldquo;I'll need some more convincing.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You're dad is in debt to mine. If you agree to marry me I'll convince him to drop it. Don't you feel bad? Who knows what'll happen to me!&rdquo; She looks at her with pleading eyes.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;With how much money he's making, I don't think it'll be a problem. And I do, but you're asking for a lot here. We&rsquo;re both girls, how would that even work?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara suddenly moves the table away and drops to her knees, taking both of Duke&rsquo;s hands and holding them with her own. She shuts her eyes, unable to look at her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather, please! Just think about it! We&rsquo;ll live in a mansion, I&rsquo;ll leave you alone for like &mdash; most of the time, and I&rsquo;ll let you spend whatever money you want! I don&rsquo;t care about what you do!&rdquo; She begged with a shaking voice.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke&rsquo;s eyes widened, her mouth now slightly agape. She couldn&rsquo;t bring herself to say anything, paralysed from the shock. McNamara could feel her face heat up in humiliation. She waits for an answer, starting to sweat from the suspense.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well, I &mdash;&rdquo; She began, finally recovering from her astonishment.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'll do whatever you want!&rdquo; McNamara interrupted, &ldquo;Just tell me what I need to do to convince you, please!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke stares at her with concern, the desperation causing her to reconsider her answer. Even though she felt awkward seeing McNamara on her knees, there was a small feeling of superiority that made her flush with both excitement and pride. Even though she&rsquo;s sure she doesn&rsquo;t derive much pleasure from similar displays. Duke released a troubled sigh and looked away from her in order to think.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t give you an answer right now, marriage seems like&hellip; a lot.&rdquo; It wasn't a clear yes or no, but McNamara's eyes still glowed with hope.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo; She asked, leaning closer.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'm not sure, but I'll let you know.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She tightened her grip on her hands and grinned. &ldquo;Thank you so much Heather! I swear, you won't regret anything!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; her voice then drops to a whisper, &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo; Duke pulled away from her hands and lightly patted her shoulder. &ldquo;Get up.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara could feel blood rush up to her head again. &ldquo;Oh, sorry.&rdquo; She quickly stood up and moved the table back in its place. She felt too embarrassed to follow up her begging with a conversation, so she stepped away from Duke and closer to the door.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I-I'll see you later. Thanks again Heather, bye!&rdquo; She stuttered, avoiding her gaze in shame.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Sure, bye,&rdquo; she nods.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara hastily exited the club room, it was a miracle that no one managed to walk in on them during all that. The idea sent a chill through her, she couldn't imagine the embarrassment! She went to the girl's bathroom, washing her hands to cool off. It went better than she had expected, even though she probably tarnished her own image in Duke&rsquo;s eyes. She could only hope that she wouldn't go ahead and gossip about it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">After a short while, the halls began to fill up with students, and McNamara contented herself with waiting for the other Heathers to enter the bathroom. She sat on the counter and thought about some other things to keep herself busy. She didn't want to bump into Kurt or Ram, not while she's alone. Chandler&rsquo;s the first one to arrive, and she wastes not a second to tell her the news.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Hey Heather, Heather said she'll think about it so you can still find guys for that plan we talked about yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Chandler looks surprised. &ldquo;What? Really?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara nodded. &ldquo;I guess she's a little more open about those types of stuff, she just looked at me really weird.&rdquo; Her face drops in worry. &ldquo;I hope she says yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Chandler gives her a jeering smile. &ldquo;God, could you imagine that? You and Heather? Oh, what would Kurt and Ram say?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather, you better keep your mouth shut.&rdquo; McNamara threatens, pointing her index finger at her.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She facetiously made a gesture as if to zip her lips shut. &ldquo;But seriously, are you sure she wasn't just pulling your leg when she said that?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;If she is then she did a damn good job at sounding serious. I think I'd know sarcasm when I hear it.&rdquo; McNamara reclines against the wall, her eyes lingering at the ceiling. &ldquo;What should I tell my parents?&rdquo; She wondered.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Why are you asking me? I don't know what the hell your parents are like.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She faces her, raising an eyebrow. &ldquo;You can't make a guess from all the stories I tell you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather, you think for yourself for once!&rdquo; She exclaims, uninterested in answering the question.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh, alright.&rdquo; McNamara sighed.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Back inside the Yearbook Club Room, Heather Duke stared thoughtfully at her research paper for English. Not really thinking about what to write next, she was absorbed in her own meditations. It didn&rsquo;t seem like McNamara was trying to play a joke on her, so she figured she should be smart about this</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She huffed and began to tap her fingers on the table. A good place to start is how she feels about her. Based on what she sees right now, she thinks of her as rowdy, and sometimes she can be a bit too much. She's also extremely sensitive, but insensitive at the same time. She'll get angry from the smallest of jests, then say something offensive and blame you for feeling bad about it. She wouldn't be the best person to live with either, she doesn't like cleaning up after herself and usually leaves her mess up to the janitors.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her image of her isn't exactly pleasant, but she still has room to grow, doesn't she? She didn't want to admit it, but the fact that she's rich made her lean towards saying yes. Her parents don't like giving her money and McNamara promising to give her any amount she wants grabbed her interest. An ill reason, but this is more of a negotiation than a marriage, so both parties should benefit out of this. The more she focused on the money, the ugly eventualities didn't seem to matter anymore. If they're incompatible&mdash; which Duke is sure they are&mdash; then they can just ignore each other, can't they?</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Duke decides to finalise her decision in a later hour, she still has school she needs to focus on. And maybe she'd have a clearer mind if she were in her room.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Moving our eyes back to Heather McNamara's parents, we see her father being in the same mood as he had been yesterday. It's been several hours since McNamara had gone out to school, and they've both spent their day watching TV shows together. He's a traditional man, so he doesn't usually watch television. He laughs and crackles at the jokes, earning weird looks from his wife, who was sitting next to him.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">A few moments later, they hear a knock on the door. He turns down the volume of the TV and Heather McNamara enters with an expression he can't quite discern. Not something he was hoping to see.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;So?&rdquo; He looked at her expectantly.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara &mdash; for just a quick moment &mdash; questions if she should say yes despite what Duke said. She didn't want to give him the happiness of saying no, so she settled with: &ldquo;they said they'll think about it.&rdquo; Besides, it's not totally a lie.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">He looked at his wife with perplexity as if to say: &ldquo;what does that mean?&rdquo; She shrugs in response and turns the volume back up when McNamara leaves to go to her room.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">In a few neighborhoods away, we find Heather Duke watching the sun set outside her window. Her mind hadn't changed much from when she was at the club room. She felt a little bit horrible that she was only going to agree because of the money, but eased herself by saying that McNamara will be much safer with her compared to a random man in his 50s. Both of them will benefit out of this, so really, is there any harm in saying yes?</p>
            <p dir="ltr">The only thing pushing her away from that decision is her incompatibility with McNamara. They have nothing in common apart from their age. They don't agree with a lot of things, and she possesses some objectionable traits. Duke could see this being a problem, but she didn't really think of it as a big deal. It&rsquo;s not like she wants to get married to a man either, she&rsquo;d rather focus on her career. Marrying McNamara would give her the benefits she&rsquo;ll need to climb the ladder.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She makes up her mind, she'll say yes. She decides to tell her in person tomorrow in case she ever changes her mind later. She finally turns her gaze from outside her window to focus on the work she has to do, but a sudden thought makes her pause. She&rsquo;ll need to inform her parents. She isn't sure how she should approach them, but as they're currently resting in their room, she figured that talking to them at dinner would be the best time.</p>
