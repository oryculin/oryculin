            <p dir="ltr">On a quiet Sabbath night, the McNamara's residence held an apprehensive atmosphere. Two figures stood in the living room: one a woman, and the other a man, talking among themselves. They spoke in a hushed tone, discussing something important.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Let me see the list.&rdquo; Minerva &mdash; the mother of Heather McNamara &mdash; said.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Silas &mdash; her husband &mdash; nodded and handed her ten pieces of paper containing the profiles of ten men with details such as net worth, age, and occupation, all accompanied with some portraits. The woman carefully examined each one and meditated.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I made it easier for her to look for what she wants. So it's a little bit dumbed down.&rdquo; He pointed at the paper.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I can tell.&rdquo; She replied, putting it down on the coffee table. &ldquo;There's something wrong with the list though.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Silas looked at her curiously. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She raised an eyebrow as if the error was obvious. &ldquo;These men are more than twice her age! Are you trying to get her killed?&rdquo; She exclaimed.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I'm trying to keep our business alive! Heather can't run it herself, she needs a man to take charge!&rdquo; He reasoned.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Yes, but can't you find people her age? Do you even know who these men are?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;They're rich businessmen.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Personally, Silas. Personally!&rdquo; She clarified, rubbing her hand on her forehead.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">He shrugs. &ldquo;So? It doesn't matter, as long as someone can take over when I'm gone, I don't see a problem.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Did the alcohol shrink your brain? She won't agree to this, what makes you think she will?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I don't care about what she thinks!&rdquo; He scowls. &ldquo;What's important is that she chooses who she wants to get married to. Do you want to make our lives harder? I'm not remaking the list, we don't have any time left.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Fine, I guess I shouldn't have expected much of you.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What you have to worry about is Heather.&rdquo; Came Silas&rsquo; reply. &ldquo;She'll blow up at anything, it's ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She tutted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, you better have a plan B if anything goes wrong.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">He scoffs, a confident smile creeping up his face. &ldquo;I don't need a plan B, everything's going to work out just fine.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She tutted once more and waved her hand as if to tell him to make a move. &ldquo;Call her down, let's make this quick.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Upstairs, Heather McNamara laid down on her bed, staring at her ceiling. She was being swallowed by a feeling of hopelessness. Her eyes swelled and she could've sworn that the room started to melt into swirls. A terrible headache starts to form. She had just turned seventeen yesterday.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">At the time of the celebration, she couldn't taste a bite nor could she enjoy the music, as she knew what would become of her after. So, instead, she sat at a corner silently bewailing. The guests wouldn't have been able to tell that it was her birthday if the invitation card didn't have her name written on it. She only responded to greetings with a slight nod or a flat hum. She was aware that it was rude, but she couldn't bring herself to be concerned about it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Her focus had been devoted to worrying about marriage. Her parents are expecting her to choose a husband to marry when she turns twenty. Well, originally she was supposed to do so when she was fifteen.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She discovered that most of the men were twice her age, so she quickly changed her mind. She feared for her future if those were her only options, so she convinced her parents to postpone the decision until she turned seventeen, telling them that she needs more time to choose. She hoped that the list would change, and it did, just not the change she preferred. Now only one or two of the men were barely less than forty years old.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather!&rdquo; Shouted her dad from downstairs.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara&rsquo;s hands went cold and a sense of dread came over her. She didn&rsquo;t want to leave her room, but she knows she has to. So with a torpid pace, she walked down to the living room and sat on the couch. Her parents stood before her, talking to one another. McNamara fixed her gaze on the floor to hide the sour look on her face.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She entertained herself by examining the design of their rug, well there was no design to marvel at, as it's a plain white. She could hear them whisper to each other, and it went on for so long that she raised her head to see what they were doing. They seemed to be in disagreement about something. She sighed in impatience, she could easily predict what they were going to say. She doesn&rsquo;t need all this unnecessary suspense.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Finally, her father withdrew from his spouse with an earnest countenance and faced her. &ldquo;Heather,&rdquo; he starts, &ldquo;do you know why you're here?&rdquo; McNamara gave him a foul stare, staying silent. She averts her eyes in contempt. She'd spit at his face if she could, but the consequences would be ugly.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Silas furrows his brows but doesn't question it. &ldquo;Well, I know that you're aware that you're turning twenty soon, right?&rdquo; His pace was slow, as if he&rsquo;s carefully picking out his words as they made their way out of his mouth. Something Silas tends to do when he&rsquo;s speaking to people younger than him, since he thinks they wouldn&rsquo;t understand him if he speaks normally.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara huffed as she replied. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re aware that you're going to have to make some really important decisions, right?&rdquo; McNamara wrinkled her eyebrows and turned her head towards him, wondering if he&rsquo;s wasting her time on purpose.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;...Yes.&rdquo; She eventually said.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;And I'm sure I can trust you to do the smart thing, right?&rdquo; He forced a smile onto his face, clearly communicating what response he wanted to hear. McNamara doesn't reply, it would be a lie to say yes and to say no would end her up with a bruise or two. Her father notices her silence, and decides to continue.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Surely I don't have to spoon feed it to you?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara furiously straightened, ready to leave. &ldquo;Dad! I'm seventeen! I don't want to think about that yet!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You know you have to. You don't have a choice!&rdquo; He shouted, and McNamara flinched in surprise. She normally wouldn't be frightened by his voice, but aware of how serious he is about this, he might just break her skull this time. &ldquo;I have three more years! Can't we just talk about this some other day?&rdquo; She begged with great desperation. She wishes that he would view this as a parent, and not as a businessman.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;No, I have to talk with the family.&rdquo; He sternly said. &ldquo;Less than three years isn't enough.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Dad, seriously, what&rsquo;s the difference if I get married at twenty versus if I get married at thirty? Why do I even need to get married&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Suddenly, he bellowed in anger, grabbing a vase and throwing it in her direction. &ldquo;Because you're a useless piece of shit of a daughter! You can't do anything, you don't know anything! God, I could kill you!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara didn&rsquo;t have any time to react, so the vase nearly hit her. &ldquo;What the fuck dad?&rdquo; She cries out in disbelief and looks at her mother as if to implore her to do something.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Minerva did not care to intervene, as she contented herself with sitting on an armchair and observing the two. She actually thought that his words were reasonable.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Silas breathes out a low sigh in order to compose himself. &ldquo;Heather, there's going to be a time where we're not here to support you anymore, you can't run our business by yourself, that's why you need a man to do all the work for you. You're getting married at twenty. You can't change that, and you're choosing your husband now.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Despite her agitation, she dared to reply. &ldquo;What&hellip;&rdquo; She began, stammering. &ldquo;What kind of conversation are you guys going to have that it's going to take you three years?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Silas remained inflexible. &ldquo;That's not important, Heather.&rdquo; He scowls, starting to lose his temper again. &ldquo;Look, I let you avoid this before, I can't let you avoid it now!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;And what if I don't want to get married, dad? You can't just force me!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">His face darkened. &ldquo;Yes I can.&rdquo; He knew didn't need to specify how. McNamara understood the threat, and wanted to believe that it's a lie, but she knew there was some truth behind it.&nbsp;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Do it!&rdquo; She goaded, standing up. &ldquo;I'd rather die than marry some geriatric asshole you have lined up for me!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Heather, stop being so difficult! Just comply and you'll thank yourself in the future!&rdquo; His hands clenched into fists, ready to throw a punch if he felt like it.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara nervously clenched her jaw but still made an effort to stand firm. &ldquo;I said I don't want to, Dad! Did you even think about this? You're marrying me off to someone older than you! This is messed up!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Age doesn't matter, Heather. If you both love each other then that shouldn't be a problem! You haven't even met them yet, just give it a chance!&rdquo; Silas picked up the papers and held it up for her to grab.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara looked at him as if he was insane. &ldquo;No, I'm done with this!&rdquo; She immediately drew away from them and ran her way to the stairs.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Silas was left stupefied for a moment. &ldquo;Heather, sit back down right now!&rdquo; He demanded. He would have ran after her and pulled her by the hair if he hadn't injured his ankle recently. He gnashed his teeth, crumpling the paper in his hands and throwing it at the floor.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;We always give you what you want, what you need, we do everything in this house and work for everything we have! You don't even need to move a muscle! The least you could do is marry into a rich family, for God's sake&mdash;&rdquo; He began to let go of several oaths and other vulgar words, continuing until he had nothing left to say.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">By this point, McNamara had already gone upstairs and into her room. The sound of a door slamming shut resounded in the house.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Oh, sure, go ahead and break your door! Do that again and I'll fucking take it away and bash the stupidity out of you!&rdquo; He shouted. He just couldn't understand what was so hard about choosing a husband. If she gets something good out of it, who cares what happens next?</p>
            <p dir="ltr">He takes this opportunity to recover his poise. He drags himself over to the couch and sits down, then he begins to complain in an inane manner. &ldquo;She's useless! She's almost twenty and she's useless! She can't even choose a husband, who the hell does she think she is?&rdquo; Silas cries out.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Minerva&mdash; who hasn't moved a muscle until now&mdash; spoke up. &ldquo;Well, you can't be that mad, can you? I'll be surprised if none of those men are at risk of cardiac arrest.&rdquo; She wasn't happy that he was marrying her off to some old geezers, but she&mdash;just like her husband&mdash; doesn't think McNamara would be able to fill in her father's position.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; He buries his face in his hands.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She wanted to laugh but restrained herself. &ldquo;What happened to not needing a plan B?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Silas clenches his fists, revealing the crazed look on his face. &ldquo;Plan B is being of help! Why don't you actually try to fix things for once? I can't always do things around here!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Well it's hard to keep up when you always destroy everything.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You're getting on my nerves!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She closes her eyes, in thought for a moment. &ldquo;I've thought of something, but I know you're not going to like it.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;I don't have any ideas left so you might as well just tell me.&rdquo; Silas huffed, leaning back on the couch.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Let her choose who to marry.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">He wrinkles his brows and squints at her. &ldquo;But&hellip; she is choosing?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;That's not what I meant. Let her choose who she wants.&rdquo; And to this, he stared at her in astonishment. &ldquo;Are you crazy?! She can&rsquo;t do that, God! Did you hit your head?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Ask yourself that,&rdquo; she retorted, &ldquo;it's going to make things easier for us, you know.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Speak for yourself!&rdquo; He rose to his feet. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be easy when we end up dying at the side of a road!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;That should be the least of your worries, if Heather kills herself, what then?&rdquo; She argued, standing up herself. &ldquo;If she dies and you die after her, it's over with your business!&rdquo; Her hand inched closer to the cane resting beside her chair. The situation would have turned ugly if only Silas knew what to say next.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Unable to think of a reply and needing a way to let out his anger, he picked up an armchair and threw it at the wall. The chair damaged an expensive painting, but they can just replace it some other day. Minerva remained motionless, accustomed to his tantrums. &ldquo;If she chooses&hellip;&rdquo; He anguished, &ldquo;what if he&rsquo;s poor? We&rsquo;ll be ruined!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;What's the point if he's rich? You just need someone to take over, don't you?&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You can't trust those brutes, Minerva! What if he steals our money and runs off with it?&rdquo; He exclaimed in a rough and shaken voice, as if he could imagine it happening right before his eyes.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Then tell her that he has to be rich!&rdquo; She shook her head in disbelief. &ldquo;Use your brain to think for once! She clearly doesn't want to choose from your lineup, so let her make her own!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">He grunts, finally accepting that continuing on with his original plan wouldn&rsquo;t work and arguing would waste their time. &ldquo;Fine.&rdquo; He begrudgingly said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go talk to her.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">While walking away, he went back to feeling sorry for himself, this time in quiet, incoherent mutters.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Heather McNamara is sitting at her desk, listening to the radio. She decided that she might as well enjoy the time she has left with the device, knowing that her father will likely take it away along with the other things she likes using.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">No matter how much she turned up the volume or forced her focus on the sounds from the radio, her mind keeps replaying the events from minutes ago. Her heart spills with bitterness and wrath, she feels completely crushed. No one should be able to talk to her like that, she thought. She groaned miserably and restrained herself from striking the radio in rage. She wonders if she'll even be here tomorrow, not that she has a problem with dying, but because she'll die by her father's hand, and she'd rather give that kind of labour to either herself or the universe.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She hears heavy footsteps, and then a knock.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t bother answering it, as she knows who's outside. &ldquo;Heather, your mother and I talked.&rdquo; The muffled voice of her father said. &ldquo;You can choose who you want to marry.&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara turned to face the door, gazing at it furiously. &ldquo;Dad, I told you, I don't want to marry anyone!&rdquo; She yells.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">Silas violently hits his fists against the door, causing her to recoil in fear. &ldquo;I don't fucking care! You can choose or I'll have you eating the dirt off the streets! You have until Friday. Time is ticking, Heather!&rdquo;</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara stands up and begins to find something that would protect her from him if he ever chooses to tear the door off its hinges. &ldquo;Seriously?! That's five days, Dad!&rdquo; She shouted, rummaging through her closet.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;You're lucky we're even giving you a choice! You better make sure that man is rich, or I'll stab your eyes out with your make-up brushes!&rdquo; His voice rang in her ears, loud enough to cause her a quick but mild headache.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Okay, okay! I get it!&rdquo; She yells so that he'll stop screaming. She hears his footsteps slowly fade away, it's hard to ignore his walking, you can feel the vibrations from each step. He would've made a good soldier, and maybe she wouldn't have to be so miserable if he were dying in the trenches.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">McNamara waits a few minutes after the footsteps have disappeared before going back to sit down. She dropped her head on the desk and angrily ran her fingers through her hair. She groaned in frustration and gnashed her teeth.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">A million voices shout in her mind, crying for her to go against what her parents say for once in her life. But it all disappeared once she regained sense. Several questions began to stir in her head, each one asked louder than the other. Should she just accept being kicked out of the house? Should she actually try finding a suitor? Maybe she could steal some money from her parents wallets and leave? No, she'll run out of it soon, and poverty is worse. If what she sees from the movies are true, then she'd rather endure living with a man that's a step away from being a sex offender.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">A series of events began to show itself before her eyes. She was suddenly thrown on a sidewalk by her father, and then echoes of oaths and epithets were thrown at her, but she couldn't distinguish any of it. Once he drove off, she saw the scenes of what happens in the slums of the country. She couldn't imagine herself in their position, but she knew once the time comes, they would be equals, doing the same things for the same reason.</p>
            <p dir="ltr">She didn't want to risk anything, and she knew that she didn't have the courage to face those kinds of challenges. After one last moment of cursing her mother to go to hell and praying that her father gets drafted some day, she cleared her mind and began to think of a list before tomorrow.</p>
