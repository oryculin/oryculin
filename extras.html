            <p>This is my tumblr account, I post updates sometimes and just do whatever I want to do with it. It's a little disorganised but I'll maybe start cleaning up and tag things properly someday.</p>

            <p>This is my tumblr art account, I post my drawings here. It isn't anything special though, but check it out if you want.</p>

            <p>It's a little unused, but I'll come back to it someday. I like the format I've done here but I can't say I like the art. I'll redraw all of it some other day, and maybe I've already redrawn the images by the time you're viewing this. Send the account an ask, it's very welcome.</p>

            <p>These are a list of prompts that I have made and decided to share. I obviously won't be able to write all of the ideas I have, so why not share? I will be regularly checking and updating this collection. I'm going to be adding some new ones as time passes. I won't be deleting any of the works, just as long as it follows the prompt, so don't worry.</p>

            <p>I use this one for taking art requests and all that other stuff. There's no guarantee that I'll take your request though, so keep that in mind.</p>
